## Preface

<!-- The preface is written in the author's voice.
     It answers three questions:
       - Why does this book exist? (the gap it fills)
       - Why now? (what changed that makes this urgent)
       - Why you? (what credentials or experience qualify you to write it)
     It is NOT a summary of the book — that belongs in the Introduction.
     Typical length: 2–5 pages. -->

[PREFACE PLACEHOLDER]

<!-- Suggested elements:
     - The moment or problem that prompted this book
     - What the book argues that hasn't been said before
     - Who it is written for
     - Any biographical context that establishes credibility
     - Brief acknowledgment of what the book does NOT cover

    INTRODUCTION — Chapter 0 / roadmap chapter.

    The Introduction does different work than the Preface:
      - Preface  = why the book exists, why you wrote it (author's voice)
      - Introduction = what the book argues and how it is organized (reader's roadmap)

    This chapter is fully numbered in the body and can be as long as needed.
    Pearl's "The Mind Over Data" and Molnar's Introduction are good models:
    both are substantive, argument-first, and tell the reader exactly what
    to expect from each subsequent chapter.

<!-- Opening: state the central problem or claim in the first paragraph.
     Do not throat-clear. Do not say "In this book I will..." -->

     4. How to read it — linear vs. jump-around, prerequisites, etc.

## How This Book Is Organized

## Chapters

| File | Title | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
{chapter_rows}
## Figures

Each chapter ends with a **Prompts** section containing ready-to-paste
prompts for recreating its D3 figures. Load `brutalist/CLAUDE.md` and
`brutalist/DESIGN.md` into your Claude project context before using them.

Cowork enrichment generates:
- `images/{slug}-fig-NN.svg` — static SVG (→ PNG for EPUB)
- `d3/{slug}-fig-NN.html` — interactive D3 HTML

Then convert SVGs to PNG:
```bash
node SCRIPTS/svg-to-png.mjs
```

Or via npm:
```bash
npm run svg-to-png
```

## Build

```bash
npm install        # first time only
./build.sh
```

Output goes to `output/` (gitignored).
