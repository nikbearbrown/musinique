# Nix wrapper that connects the cargo-nix-plugin output to buildRustCrate.
#
# Usage (lockfile resolve):
#   let
#     cargoNix = import ./lib {
#       inherit pkgs;
#       src = ./.;  # workspace root with Cargo.toml + Cargo.lock
#     };

#
# Usage (explicit metadata — pre-generated cargo metadata JSON):
#   let
#     cargoNix = import ./lib {
#       inherit pkgs;
#       metadata = builtins.readFile ./metadata.json;
#       cargoLock = builtins.readFile ./Cargo.lock;
#       src = ./.;  # workspace root
#     };
#   in cargoNix.workspaceMembers
#
# Clippy: use `clippy` to get per-workspace-member clippy checks that
# reuse Nix-cached dependency builds:
#   cargoNix.clippy.allWorkspaceMembers  # check all members
#   cargoNix.clippy.workspaceMembers.<name>.build  # check one member

  # `"${url}#${rev}"` (url without `git+`/`?query`). Auto-derived from

  # set `submodules = true` per-source.
