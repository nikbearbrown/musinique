# BUILD-PROMPT — Claude, Scouting (`claude-liam-research`)

Paste this into Claude Code from your `books/` root (where `brutalist-art/` lives).
Typically under `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` — the pipeline is git-tracked,
regenerable, and GATE P still requires your signature before any audio spend.

Build the deep-explainer reel at books/anthropics/books/claude-cowork-plugins/youtube/claude-liam-research/.

The plan is authored: read beat_sheet.json, PLAN.md, SOURCES.md, and the book-level
FACTCHECK.md (books/anthropics/books/claude-cowork-plugins/FACTCHECK.md). Then:

1. SCHEMA RECONCILE. Load runtime/schema/beat_sheet.schema.json and conform this
   beat_sheet.json to it exactly — field names, scene keys, shot/vox_run/handoff
   shape. This sheet was authored to the deep-explainer doctrine but may use loose
   field names; fix them to the schema without changing content, lanes, narration,
   or the act order. Keep the spine: ClaudeComposerAsk cold open (ask answered) →
   body → ClaudeVerdictArtifact → ClaudeComposerAsk "Your turn." → ClaudeTitleOutro.

2. LANE-MIX LINT. Run the beat-mix histogram. Target and authored actuals:
   VOX 23.1% (6), MANIM 26.9% (7), REMOTION 30.8% (8), CARD 19.2% (5) over 26 body
   beats — all inside band. Confirm no >2 consecutive same-lane run except the
   intended vox run B20→B21.

3. GATE P. Present the full narration (B00 → O01) on an animated SLATE PREVIZ for my
   sign-off. Do NOT generate audio until I approve. Channel is claude-liam:
   Kokoro am_onyx, free. No ElevenLabs. Confirm the open ("Namaste — this is Liam,
   in for Bear.") and sign-off ("Liam, in for Bear.") land.

4. AUDIO LOCK. python3 runtime/scripts/generate_audio.py <reel> (Kokoro/am_onyx).
   Per-beat mp3 durations become the clock; align writes the word clock. Captions
   via the faster-whisper pipeline.

5. SHOPPING LIST (Gate D2, AFTER audio lock). For every VOX beat (B02, B08, B13,
   B16, B20, B21), first run python3 runtime/scripts/pantry_search.py on its
   pantry_note terms against svg/svg/images/. Copy real matches into pantry/
   pre-checked; write SHOPPING.md from the LOCKED durations for the rest. All six
   are Tier 1 illustrative (no rights escalation, no real people, brands, or places).
   B20→B21 share one continuous room (vox_run R1) — shop them as a matched pair.

6. GATE D1 PREVIZ. ./brutalist-art/art run <reel> — full compile, slates in the
   vox slots, Manim/Remotion rendered for real, --review burn-in. This is a previz,
   not a cut. I review pacing and source the stills.

7. PANTRY FILL → REVIEW CUT. After I drop stills into pantry/, re-run (only changed
   slots recompile). Set shot.focus per still; author the B20→B21 handoff so the
   camera move is continuous across the matched desk.

8. VISUAL QC LAW. Frame-level QC pass (CLAUDE-CODE-VISUAL-QC-CHECK.md): sample ≥2fps
   + 15/50/85% of each beat, actually read the PNGs, audit the 9-point rubric, fix
   root causes in scene source, re-render until zero BLOCKER/MAJOR. Log _qc/REPORT.md.

9. ./brutalist-art/art final <reel>. Master stays in the folder. DO NOT PUBLISH —
   going public is a manual Studio flip.

Manim scenes referenced (build from animated_graphics.py, white canvas, ink + one
terracotta #D97757): scale_day_to_hour, convergence_sources_to_meaning, positioning_map,
gap_coverage_grid, divergence_purpose_focuses, compare_two_options, contradictions_retained
— all MOVING DATA (a bar collapsing, dots converging, a 2-axis positioning map, a
coverage grid with a gap, a divergence spray, a weighted comparison, retained
contradictions). Remotion: ChipGrid, SourceFlow, PredictCard, code-block (Onda), plus
the illustration scenes named in the sheet (summary-vs-synthesis, citation-tracking,
market-entry-briefing). Retint deck patterns to the claude stage (cream #F2F0E9,
ink #3D3929, accent #D97757) and log the retint.

FACT-CHECK — enforce in narration AND on screen:
- Do NOT claim a dedicated official "Research plugin" SKU exists. Keep it capability-first
  (market-research workflows / research support). The title cards are branding only.
- Never hardcode plugin counts, prices, platform lists, or "as of [month]" framing.
- Reference managers / example companies are fleeting examples only, never a beat subject.

Honor every parent law: COLD OPEN, ILLUSTRATE, SHOW-DON'T-TELL, SPARK-LINE, ASK→RESULT,
REBUILD, DOUBLE-CHECK, FILL-THE-CANVAS, LOGO, HANDOFF (prompt read + discussed), OUTRO,
VISUAL QC, IN-FOR-BEAR, GATE P.
```

## Notes for the builder
- **Render happens on your toolkit machine**, not in the authoring sandbox — this
  folder is the complete authoring package (`beat_sheet.json` + plan + sources + this
  prompt); the `art`/Remotion/Manim/Kokoro runtime consumes it.
- Whole-batch build: see `youtube/BUILD-ALL.md` at the project root to render all
  reels in chapter order with one paste.
