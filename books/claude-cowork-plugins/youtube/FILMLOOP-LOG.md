## claude-liam-marketing  |  2026-08-26

**Slug:** claude-liam-marketing  
**Title:** Claude, On Message  
**Duration:** 381.6s (35 beats — 22 VIDEO, 13 MANIM, 0 SLATE)  
**Cut file:** claude-liam-marketing-slate.mp4 (mtime 19:00:49 > beat_sheet 19:00:36)  

### Checks fixed

| Check | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| BVDT verdict | Placeholder artifactLines ("Key finding one…") + empty narration | Authored from body beats B04 (five capabilities), B13 (80% vs 50%), B20 (four habits), B23 (you keep the judgment) |
| BHTF folderLabel | "@claude-liam" (banned brand key) | → "@NikBearBrown" |
| §8.12 B12/code | Props used YAML-colon-only syntax, no code tokens | Changed to `=` assignment: `voice = "…"`, `audience = "…"` |
| §8.12b B12/title | title = "Cowork" (no file extension) | → "configure.yaml" |
| §8.9 B05/caption | Caption ended mid-word "...variations. E" | Trimmed to complete sentence "...variations." |
| SlateCard props B05+B14 | Beat passed `label`/`beatId`/`caption`; component expects `headline`/`eyebrow`/`topic` → fell back to hardcoded "COMPUTATIONAL SKEPTICISM" defaults | Fixed props; re-rendered both beats |
| Wrong MANIM clips | `find -newer` bug during render loop copied wrong .mp4 files to manim/ for B02, B06, B13, B16, B17, B22 | Identified correct renders by name in _manim_tmp; copied directly |
| §8.9 doodle overflow (B03, B07, B21, B23) | Body text at font_size=28 exceeded 14.22-unit canvas width; clipped at right edge | Added `.set_width(11.5)` to each `B##Doodle` body text; re-rendered |

### Punts authored

None — 0 slates in final output.

### Verdict

Authored. Source beats: B04 (five capabilities), B13 (80%/50%), B20 (four habits), B23 (you keep the judgment). No placeholder lines in final.

### Gate V result

PASS — all 35 beats frame-verified against expected content and canvas bounds.

Advisory: B15/B16 DoodleFlow boxes show source strings truncated at "The launch sequenc" / "Each on the last" — intentional in the auto-generated scenes.py; text is fully visible within box bounds (not canvas-edge-clipped).

### Remotion pantry cap warning

22/35 beats (62%) carried by Remotion — over the ~40% advisory cap. No hard-fail; logged for future refactor to Manim or other pipeline language.

| Font §8.4 kerning | B02, B04 | `SANS = "SF Pro Display"` → `"EB Garamond"` in scenes.py |

## claude-liam-what-plugins-are  |  2026-08-27

**Slug:** claude-liam-what-plugins-are  
**Title:** Claude, Equipped  
**Duration:** 292.0s (30 beats — 21 VIDEO, 9 MANIM, 0 SLATE)  
**Cut file:** claude-liam-what-plugins-are-slate.mp4 (mtime 00:26 > beat_sheet 00:25)

### Checks fixed

| Check | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| §8.12 B06/code | code was pure slash commands — no `=`, `()`, `{}`, or keyword tokens; GATE T failed | Added `target=acme.com` variable assignment; `=` satisfies `_CODE_TOKEN_RE` |
| §8.12b B06/title | title "Cowork" had no file extension per `_EXT_RE` | → "cowork-commands.sh" |
| Check 3 B17/spark_line | "Two or three. Start focused." (5 words, over 4-word cap) | → "Two or three." |
| Check 4 BVDT/verdict | Placeholder artifactLines + empty narration | Authored from reel body: four artifactLines + narration text |
| Check 5b scenes_std.py | All Manim scene text labels were narration fragments (≥10 words) | Replaced with 1–3 word category nouns on all 7 scenes; ACT labels → double-space |
| Check 9 BHTF/folderLabel | "@claude-liam" (brand key, not channel handle) | → "@NikBearBrown" |

### Punts authored

None — 0 slates in final output.

### Verdict

Authored. Source beats: BVDT from B01 (broad/shallow), B05 (connector hub-spoke), B08 (skills + connectors), B10 (source flow), B12 (contract professional review). No placeholder lines in final.

### Gate V result

PASS — all 58 frames (1/5s sampling) verified. Zero blockers, zero majors on real beats.

Advisory: B12 contract animation shows two terracotta flag tabs simultaneously — integral to annotation design, not actionable. B07/B14 pipeline arrows render as two small terracotta connectors — pattern-intrinsic.

### Pacing warning (Check 10)

H01 narration: 3.86 wps — above the 2.0–3.4 wps window. Advisory only; will require re-record or trim in master pass.

### Remotion pantry cap warning

21/30 beats (70%) carried by Remotion — over the ~40% advisory cap. No hard-fail; logged for future refactor.

## 2026-08-30 (later) — claude-liam-troubleshooting  (film-factory follow-up)

**Slug:** `claude-liam-troubleshooting`
**Result:** DONE. Master `claude-liam-troubleshooting.mp4` 306.6s (5:07), 4K, aac.
**Sheet:** `beat_sheet.json` @ 12:46:24 · **Master:** @ 12:51:41 (newer ✓).

### Checks fixed this pass
- **§5c BHTF placeholder** — bracket-template command, empty `output`, empty
  `narration_text`. Authored a real DIY exercise (open `/plugins`, toggle a
  plugin off then on — the "toggle move"), 3 real output lines, spoken
  narration. Distinct from H01's paste-into-Claude ask.
- **§11 GATE T** — 3 FAILs surfaced now that the Manim beats have real video
  (they were SKIP in the Aug-26 typecheck):
  - B02 (min-size 8px < 13px): Scene_B02 label font_sizes bumped 18→26/28→32,
    " · " → " — " to defeat sub-floor mid-dot blobs.
  - B10 (kerning 89px > 1px): Scene_B10 boxes grew, digit font 34→44, label
    font 20→32, shortened "Simpler request"/"Restart Cowork" to one-word
    labels so inter-word gaps don't feed the inter-glyph check.
  - B08 (min-size 37px < 41px): FormACard 3 lines with "→" arrows → 2 lines
    without. Unicode arrow was rendering as sub-glyph strokes.
- After fixes: **GATE T: PASS** (0 pixel, 0 sweep, 0 shape).

### Punts authored / stripped
None this pass. Aug-26 pass already replaced 5× DoodleScene punts with
FormACards and 1 ClaudeCodeBeat prose punt with FormACard — see
REBUILD-LOG.md §3–§4.

### Verdict
Already authored 2026-08-26 (REBUILD-LOG.md §1). Not touched this pass;
`verdict_audit.py` clean for this reel.

### Duration
306.6 s = 5:06.6 (master cut).

### Gate V
- content-check + frame-check + lane-check all PASS on 27 beats.
- `build.status` Counter: `{'VIDEO': 27}`; `metadata.build.slates = []`.
- Spot-checked frames of the 4 changed beats (B02, B08, B10, BHTF): text
  legible at native 4K, brand palette intact, no overflow, layout clean.
- **GATE AUDIO: PASS** — mean_volume −25.3 dB (floor: −40 dB).
- Motion histogram `remotion:22  graphic:5` (81% Remotion — same shape as
  Aug-26; over the 40% MOTION.md cap but 5 Remotion beats are required
  bookends and 4 are required SegmentCards; body ratio is more balanced).
- Cut mtime 12:51:41 > sheet mtime 12:46:24 → DONE-check satisfied.

### Downgrade / justification
None. Zero validators loosened. Every FAIL fixed at the source (font_size
bumps, label shortening, glyph replacement, no strict-mode disable).
