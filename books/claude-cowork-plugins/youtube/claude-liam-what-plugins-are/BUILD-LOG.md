# BUILD LOG — claude-liam-what-plugins-are

## Step 1 — Schema Reconcile

**Status:** DONE

Changes applied:
- `id` → `beat_id` for all beats
- `metadata.voice_kokoro: am_onyx` added (pipeline reads this, not `.voice`)
- `metadata.topic: CLAUDE · COWORK PLUGINS` added
- `shot` object added to all beats without one
- `estimated_duration_s` derived from word count (2.9 wps) for beats lacking it

**Remotion patterns used (VR* series — all use CLAUDE tokens natively):**

  C01 (SegmentCard) → VRSegmentCard — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.
  B01 (PredictCard) → VRPredictCard — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.
  C02 (SegmentCard) → VRSegmentCard — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.
  B03 (ChipGrid) → VRChipGrid — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.
  B04 (illustration/skills-auto-activate) → SlateCard (unregistered custom illustration — will render as slate in previz; needs Remotion component or pantry still before final cut).
  B08 (SparkBeat) → VRSegmentCard — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.
  C03 (SegmentCard) → VRSegmentCard — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.
  B10 (SourceFlow) → VRSourceFlow — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.
  C04 (SegmentCard) → VRSegmentCard — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.
  B13 (illustration/open-source-triptych) → SlateCard (unregistered custom illustration — will render as slate in previz; needs Remotion component or pantry still before final cut).
  C05 (SegmentCard) → VRSegmentCard — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.
  B15 (ChipGrid) → VRChipGrid — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.
  C06 (SegmentCard) → VRSegmentCard — already uses CLAUDE tokens (cream/ink/terracotta); no additional retint needed.

**Retint log:** VR* patterns (VRSegmentCard, VRChipGrid, VRPredictCard, VRSourceFlow, VRLayerStack) are from VercelRefactorIllu.tsx which imports `CLAUDE` tokens directly — cream #F2F0E9, ink #3D3929, accent/terracotta #D97757. No additional retinting required.
