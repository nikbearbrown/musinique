//! Stall detection monitor thread with signal-based stack trace capture.
//!
//! When enabled, a background monitor thread periodically polls the per-worker
//! `poll_generation` counters. If a worker's generation counter remains at the
//! same odd value between two successive checks, the worker is likely stalled
//! in a long-running synchronous call within `Future::poll`.
//!
//! On Linux, the monitor can capture a stack trace from the stalled worker
//! thread by sending a realtime signal and collecting instruction
//! pointers from within the signal handler.
//!
//! The signal handler uses an async-signal-safe frame-pointer walker instead of
//! `backtrace::trace_unsynchronized` (which internally calls `_Unwind_Backtrace`
//! -> `dl_iterate_phdr` -> glibc loader lock, making it NOT async-signal-safe).
//! Address validation is performed by attempting a `write()` to a pre-opened pipe,
//! which returns EFAULT for unreadable memory. Both raw pointer reads and `write()`
//! are POSIX async-signal-safe.
