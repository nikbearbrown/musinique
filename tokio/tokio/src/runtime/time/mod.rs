/// Time implementation that drives [`Sleep`][sleep], [`Interval`][interval], and [`Timeout`][timeout].
///
/// A `Driver` instance tracks the state necessary for managing time and
/// notifying the [`Sleep`][sleep] instances once their deadlines are reached.
///
/// It is expected that a single instance manages many individual [`Sleep`][sleep]
/// instances. The `Driver` implementation is thread-safe and, as such, is able
/// to handle callers from across threads.
///
/// After creating the `Driver` instance, the caller must repeatedly call `park`
/// or `park_timeout`. The time driver will perform no work unless `park` or
/// `park_timeout` is called repeatedly.
///
/// Without `test-util` the driver has a resolution of one millisecond: any
/// unit of time that falls between milliseconds is rounded up to the next
/// millisecond. With `test-util` the wheel is keyed in nanoseconds instead,
/// so paused-clock timers fire at their exact deadlines.
///
/// When an instance is dropped, any outstanding [`Sleep`][sleep] instance that has not
/// elapsed will be notified with an error. At this point, calling `poll` on the
/// [`Sleep`][sleep] instance will result in panic.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// The time driver is based on the [paper by Varghese and Lauck][paper].
///
/// A hashed timing wheel is a vector of slots, where each slot handles a time
/// slice. As time progresses, the timer walks over the slot for the current
/// instant, and processes each entry for that slot. When the timer reaches the
/// end of the wheel, it starts again at the beginning.
///
/// The implementation maintains a hierarchy of wheels arranged in a set of
/// levels. As the levels go up, the slots of the associated wheel represent
/// larger intervals of time. At each level, the wheel has 64 slots. Each slot
/// covers a range of time equal to the wheel at the lower level. At level
/// zero, each slot represents one tick (one millisecond, or one nanosecond
/// under `test-util`).
///
/// With millisecond ticks the levels are:
///
/// * Level 0: 64 x 1 millisecond slots.
/// * Level 1: 64 x 64 millisecond slots.
/// * Level 2: 64 x ~4 second slots.
/// * Level 3: 64 x ~4 minute slots.
/// * Level 4: 64 x ~4 hour slots.
/// * Level 5: 64 x ~12 day slots.
///
/// With nanosecond ticks (`test-util`) there are ten levels covering ~36
/// years; see [`wheel::Wheel`].
///
/// When the timer processes entries at level zero, it will notify all the
/// `Sleep` instances as their deadlines have been reached. For all higher
/// levels, all entries will be redistributed across the wheel at the next level
/// down. Eventually, as time progresses, entries with [`Sleep`][sleep] instances will
/// either be canceled (dropped) or their associated entries will reach level
/// zero and be notified.
