# Example: use Anthropic::Mcp to bridge GitHub's hosted MCP server with the
# Anthropic SDK's beta tool runner.
#
# This connects to `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` over MCP's Streamable
# HTTP transport using the official `mcp` gem (>= 0.13), lists the available
# tools, and lets Claude invoke them to answer a question about GitHub issues.
#
# Requirements:
#   - GITHUB_TOKEN env var (a GitHub PAT with at least `public_repo` scope)
#   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var
#   - The following gems installed:
#         gem install mcp faraday event_stream_parser

require_relative "../lib/anthropic"

# The Anthropic helpers themselves only require `mcp`. The two below are
# transport-level dependencies of the `mcp` gem itself, not of this SDK:
#   - `faraday`             — used by `MCP::Client::HTTP` for any remote server.
#   - `event_stream_parser` — used by `MCP::Client::HTTP` when the server
#                             returns SSE responses, which the GitHub MCP
#                             server does. Stdio servers don't need it.
# We require them explicitly so missing-gem errors surface here at the top of
# the script instead of mid-request.
