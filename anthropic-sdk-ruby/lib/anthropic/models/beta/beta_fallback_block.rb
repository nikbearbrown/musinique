        #   declined. A turn where no preceding model ran and declined has no such boundary
        #   and carries no block — the signal for whether a fallback model served the
        #   response is the presence of a `fallback_message` entry in `usage.iterations`,
        #   not this block.
        #
        #   The block is treated like a server-tool content block for streaming: it arrives
        #   via the standard `content_block_start` / `content_block_stop` pair and carries
        #   no deltas.
