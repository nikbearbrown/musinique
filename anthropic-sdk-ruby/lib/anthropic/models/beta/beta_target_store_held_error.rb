        #   to `update_existing` and another dream that writes into the same memory store
        #   hasn't fully stopped.
        #
        #   The other dream is `pending` or `running`, or it has just stopped and is still
        #   finishing its last writes. `message` gives the ID of the other dream when the
        #   server can identify it. If that dream has already reached `completed`, `failed`,
        #   or `canceled`, retry after a short wait. Otherwise, wait for the other dream to
        #   end or cancel it, then retry. The response sets the `x-should-retry` header to
        #   `false`.
