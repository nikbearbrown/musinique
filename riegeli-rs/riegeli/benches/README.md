# riegeli-rs Benchmark Matrix

Throughput benchmarks for the `riegeli-rs` library, covering the full
configuration matrix that mirrors the C++ `records_benchmark.cc`.

## Configuration Matrix

All benchmarks use **10,000 records x 1 KiB each** (approximately 10 MB total payload).
Records are proto-like with a varint index field and a length-delimited padding
field filled with a repeating pattern for realistic compressibility.

## Running Benchmarks

### Run all benchmarks

```bash
cargo bench --bench throughput --features "brotli zstd snappy"
```

### Run a single configuration

```bash
# Write benchmark for simple+none
cargo bench --bench throughput -- simple_none/write

# Read benchmark for simple+brotli:6
cargo bench --bench throughput -- simple_brotli_6/read

# All benchmarks for transpose+zstd:3
cargo bench --bench throughput -- transpose_zstd_3
```

### Run without snappy (if the `snap` crate is not available)

```bash
cargo bench --bench throughput
```

When snappy is not enabled, the `simple_snappy` row uses uncompressed mode as a
placeholder so the matrix remains at 8+ rows.

## Flamegraph Profiling

Benchmarks integrate `pprof-rs` to produce CPU flamegraph SVGs automatically.
After a benchmark run, find the SVGs at:

```
target/criterion/<group>/<bench>/profile/flamegraph.svg
```

For example:

```
target/criterion/simple_brotli_6/write/profile/flamegraph.svg
target/criterion/transpose_zstd_3/read/profile/flamegraph.svg
```

Open these SVGs in a browser for interactive flamegraph exploration.

## Interpreting Results

Criterion reports throughput in bytes/second based on the total payload size
(NUM_RECORDS x RECORD_SIZE = 10,000 x 1,024 = 10,240,000 bytes). Key things
to look for:

- **Write throughput**: Measures encoding + compression time. Higher compression
  levels (brotli:9 vs brotli:6) will be slower to write.
- **Read throughput**: Measures decompression + decoding time. This is typically
  faster than write for compressed formats.
- **simple+none**: The uncompressed baseline. Read throughput here is bounded by
  memcpy + hash verification speed and should exceed 500 MB/s.
- **Transpose overhead**: Compare transpose+none vs simple+none to measure the
  cost of transpose encoding/decoding without compression.
- **Projection benefit** (Sprint 18): The projection placeholder will eventually
  show the speedup from skipping irrelevant columns in transpose-encoded data.

## Benchmark Architecture

### `throughput.rs` (Rust-only, criterion)

The benchmark file (`throughput.rs`) is structured as:

1. **`make_records()`** - Generates deterministic proto-like records with
   repeating patterns for realistic compression ratios.
2. **`configs()`** - Returns the 8 active `BenchConfig` structs (9th is the
   projection placeholder).
3. **`bench_write()`** - For each config, creates a criterion group measuring
   full write (encode + compress + serialize) throughput.
4. **`bench_read()`** - For each config, pre-encodes the file once, then
   measures read (deserialize + decompress + decode) throughput.
5. **`bench_projection_placeholder()`** - Stub for Sprint 18's projection
   benchmark.

The criterion config uses `PProfProfiler` with 100 Hz sampling and flamegraph
output, producing SVGs alongside the standard HTML reports.

## Head-to-Head Rust-vs-C++ Benchmark

The `head_to_head.rs` benchmark compares Rust and C++ (via `riegeli-ffi`)
write throughput, read throughput, and compression ratio across the full
configuration matrix.

### Running the head-to-head benchmark

```bash
cargo bench --bench head_to_head
```

This prints a summary table to stdout with all 12 cells (6 configs x 2
payload sizes) showing Rust and C++ throughput side by side.

### Configuration matrix

| Config             | Compression | Transpose | Small (100B) | Large (10 KiB) |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------|:------------:|:--------------:|
| simple+none        | None        | No        |      Y       |       Y        |
| simple+brotli:6    | Brotli(6)   | No        |      Y       |       Y        |
| simple+zstd:3      | Zstd(3)     | No        |      Y       |       Y        |
| transpose+none     | None        | Yes       |      Y       |       Y        |
| transpose+brotli:6 | Brotli(6)   | Yes       |      Y       |       Y        |
| transpose+zstd:3   | Zstd(3)     | Yes       |      Y       |       Y        |

### Measurement methodology

- **10,000 records per cell** to amortize setup overhead
- **3 repetitions per measurement**, reporting the **median**
- **Payload**: JSON-like text prefix with binary padding for realistic
  compressibility (not all zeros, not pure random)
- **Throughput** = raw_data_size / wall_clock_time in MB/s
- **Compression ratio** = file_size / raw_data_size (lower is better)

### Interpreting results

- **Rust write vs C++ write**: The Rust implementation is pure Rust with no
  FFI overhead. The C++ side goes through `riegeli-ffi`'s cxx bridge, which
  writes to an in-memory `std::string` then copies to a `Vec<u8>`. For large
  records with fast compression (zstd), C++ write throughput can appear higher
  because the C++ compressor runs on a contiguous memory buffer.

- **Rust read vs C++ read**: The C++ reader reads via the FFI bridge, copying
  each record from a C++ `std::string` into a Rust `Vec<u8>`. This per-record
  copy overhead creates a throughput ceiling around 150-200 MB/s regardless of
  compression mode. The Rust reader has no such copy overhead and can achieve
  much higher read throughput, especially for uncompressed data.

- **Compression ratios**: Should be nearly identical between Rust and C++
  since both use the same underlying compression libraries (brotli, zstd).
  Small differences arise from file format overhead (chunk headers, padding).

- **Transpose overhead**: Transpose encoding has significant per-record
  overhead for state machine construction and column splitting. With small
  100-byte records, transpose write throughput is much lower than simple
  encoding. With large 10 KiB records, the overhead is amortized and
  throughput is closer to simple encoding.

### Performance observations

1. **Rust read throughput is significantly higher than C++ (via FFI)**: This is
   an artifact of the FFI bridge overhead, not a real difference between the
   implementations. Each C++ read copies the record across the FFI boundary.

2. **C++ write throughput is higher for large compressed records**: The C++
   writer operates on contiguous memory without Rust's `Cursor<Vec<u8>>`
   abstraction. For large records with fast compression, this can be 2-10x
   faster.

3. **Rust transpose write is slower than C++ for small records**: The Rust
   transpose encoder has higher per-record overhead, likely from more
   allocation in the state machine construction. This is a potential area
   for optimization.

4. **Compression ratios match closely**: Both implementations produce nearly
   identical compression ratios, confirming they use the same compression
   algorithms at the same levels.
