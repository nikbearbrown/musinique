/// Some models decline requests in certain policy areas, such as
/// cybersecurity or biology. With fallbacks, the API retries a declined
/// request on a substitute model, within the same request:
///
/// ```swift
/// ClaudeLanguageModel(name: .opus5_5, auth: auth, fallbacks: [.opus4_8])
/// ```
///
/// A model can decline after it has started to answer. The fallback model
/// then continues from the declining model's text, so the response reads as
/// one answer. The transcript marks the handover (see ``ClaudeModelHandover``).
///
/// After a fallback, the API serves the conversation's next requests straight
/// from the fallback model, for about an hour, as long as those requests
/// still name it. Those responses have no handover.
/// ``FoundationModels/Transcript/Response/claudeModelID`` names the model
/// that served each response.
///
/// Each fallback gets the thinking and effort it accepts, the same way the
/// requested model does. A fixed effort becomes the closest level the fallback
/// accepts. The rest of the request, including the prompt, the tools, and any
/// sampling settings, reaches the fallback unchanged.
