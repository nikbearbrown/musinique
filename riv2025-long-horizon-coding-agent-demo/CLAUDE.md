# CLAUDE.md — Project Intelligence

This file provides context for Claude Code sessions working on this repository.

## Getting Started with Claude Code

**When to activate**: If the user's first message is a greeting ("hi", "hello"), "help", "get started", "setup", "how do I use this", or otherwise doesn't specify a concrete task — run this onboarding flow. If the user comes with a specific task, skip this section entirely.

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites

Run quick version checks and report which tools are ready:

```bash
aws --version        # AWS CLI v2
docker --version     # Docker
cdk --version        # AWS CDK
gh --version         # GitHub CLI
node --version       # Node.js 18+
```

If any are missing, tell the user what to install before continuing.

### Step 2: Choose a Path

Ask the user: **"Would you like to deploy the Canopy demo app, or create a new project?"**

---

#### Path A: Deploy Canopy

Walk the user through these steps interactively, running commands and explaining output:

1. **Deploy infrastructure**: `make deploy-infra`
2. **Build and push Docker image**:
   - `make show-config` to get the ECR URI
   - `aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ECR_URI>`
   - `docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t <ECR_URI>:latest .`
   - `docker push <ECR_URI>:latest`
3. **Update runtime**: `make update-runtime-env`
4. **Wait for READY**: `make get-runtime` — poll until `"status": "READY"`
5. **Reset state**: `make reset`
6. **Create and trigger an issue**:
   - `gh issue create --repo KBB99/riv2025-long-horizon-coding-agent-demo --title "[MVP] Canopy Build" --body "Build the Canopy app as specified in BUILD_PLAN.md."`
   - Add rocket reaction to the new issue
   - `gh workflow run "Agent Builder" --repo KBB99/riv2025-long-horizon-coding-agent-demo -f issue_number=<ISSUE_NUM>`
7. **Show monitoring commands** from the "Monitoring the Agent" section below

---

#### Path B: Create a New Project

Guide the user through interactive BUILD_PLAN creation:

1. **Ask** the user to describe their app in a few sentences — what it does, who it's for
2. **Ask** about tech stack preferences. Suggest defaults (React + Vite + Tailwind frontend, Lambda + DynamoDB + CDK backend) but accept any choice. If they pick a non-default stack, note which CI/CD workflows or IAM policies may need adjustment:
   - Non-Vite frontend → update `deploy-preview.yml` build step
   - Non-Lambda backend → need new deploy workflow (the existing `deploy-infrastructure.yml` assumes CDK + Lambda)
   - Non-DynamoDB database → may need VPC config in CDK stack
3. **Ask** about key features, pages, and data models — enough detail to populate the BUILD_PLAN
4. **Read** `prompts/BUILD_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` for the skeleton structure
5. **Generate** `prompts/{name}/BUILD_PLAN.md` filling in all sections from user input
6. **Show** the generated plan and iterate until the user approves
7. **Optionally generate** `prompts/{name}/EXAMPLE_TEST.txt` and `prompts/{name}/DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md`
8. **Deploy and launch** — same steps as Path A but with `PROJECT_NAME={name}`:
   - Docker rebuild (prompts are baked into the image)
   - `make update-runtime-env PROJECT_NAME={name}`
   - `make reset`
   - Create GitHub issue referencing their project
   - Trigger the agent workflow
   - Show monitoring commands

## Current State (2026-02-26)

### What's Working

The end-to-end pipeline is fully operational:
- GitHub issue with rocket reaction triggers the agent via issue-poller → agent-builder workflow
- AgentCore container starts, clones repo, runs Claude SDK against Bedrock
- Agent generates code, commits to `agent-runtime` branch, pushes via post-commit hook
- deploy-preview workflow builds the app and deploys to CloudFront
- deploy-infrastructure workflow builds shared/backend, runs CDK tests, and deploys the stack
- Agent subprocess output is visible in CloudWatch via Python logging/OTEL

### Issue #22 — Backend Test Verification Fix (SUCCESS)

**The problem (issue #17):** Despite building the backend correctly (shared → infra → backend → frontend), all 220 tests were frontend-only. Zero shared/infrastructure/backend tests.

**Root cause:** A hardcoded screenshot gate in `src/security.py` prevented marking ANY test as passing without a Playwright screenshot + console file. Since there was no verification path for backend tests, the agent rationally wrote only frontend tests.

**Fix applied (commits on `kb/improved-harness`):**
- Created `frontend-scaffold-template/backend-verify.cjs` — runs shell commands and produces `-result.txt` + `-console.txt` artifacts
- Added alternative verification path in `src/security.py` — accepts `-result.txt` with `VERIFIED_BY: backend-verify.cjs` sentinel instead of requiring screenshots
- Added AWS data-plane commands to security allowlist (DynamoDB scan/query, CloudWatch logs, Lambda invoke)
- Added IAM permissions in CDK stack (`AgentCoreBackendTestPolicy`) for canopy-* scoped resources
- Updated prompts with backend-verify.cjs examples for all categories
- Updated `claude_code.py` initial + continuation messages with category-specific verification guidance

**Result (issue #22):** 54/54 tests passing — 3 shared, 7 infrastructure, 6 backend, 38 frontend. 18 tests use backend-verify.cjs, 36 use playwright variants. Build order correct: shared → infra → backend → frontend.

### Prompt Update: CDK-First Deployment Flow (commit `3744400`)

The previous agent runs (issues #17, #22) showed the agent writing CDK infrastructure and backend Lambda handlers simultaneously, never waiting for CI/CD deployment, and never wiring `VITE_API_URL` into the frontend. Three problems:
1. Frontend defaulted to localStorage because `VITE_API_URL` was never set
2. Agent never polled SSM deploy-state — zero CloudWatch log entries for "deploy", "ssm", "apiUrl"
3. deploy-infrastructure workflow failed 3 times due to missing build steps (**fixed in `4a8867c`**)

**Fix applied (commit `3744400`):** Updated prompts in `prompts/system_prompt.txt`, `prompts/canopy/system_prompt.txt`, and `claude_code.py` to enforce a CDK-first deployment flow:
- Split old "Phase 2: Infrastructure + Backend" into **Phase 2a** (CDK + stub handlers, commit and push) and **Phase 2b** (poll SSM deploy-state until succeeded, then implement full handlers)
- Phase 3 now explicitly wires `VITE_API_URL` by reading the API URL from SSM deploy-state and creating `frontend/.env`
- `claude_code.py` initial message now says "WAIT for CI/CD deployment" and "Do NOT proceed until status=succeeded"
- `claude_code.py` continuation message simplified to check deploy-state and wire `VITE_API_URL` if missing
- Added `--region us-east-1` to all SSM commands (was missing before)

**Status: VERIFIED (2026-02-26).** Live agent run confirmed the agent follows the CDK-first wait-then-wire flow: commits CDK + stubs first, polls SSM deploy-state, writes full handlers after deployment succeeds, and creates `frontend/.env` with `VITE_API_URL`.

### Previous Fixes (for reference)

**Phase ordering (issue #17, commit `8dfdae7`):** Replaced grading language with phase-completion incentives. Agent went from building frontend-only to building shared → infra → backend → frontend correctly.

**IAM role mismatch (issue #20-21):** CDK deployed policies to wrong IAM role (`AmazonBedrockAgentCoreSDKRuntime-*` instead of `claude-code-agentcore-role`). Container silently crashed. Fixed by adding `AGENTCORE_ROLE_NAME` and `VPC_ID` as Makefile defaults for `deploy-infra`.

### Quick Start: Run a New Test

```bash
# 1. Reset all state (deletes agent-runtime branch, clears SSM, empties S3)
make reset

# 2. (If you changed code/prompts) Rebuild and push Docker image
make show-config  # get ECR_URI
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 669298908997.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t 669298908997.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/claude-code-reinvent:latest .
docker push 669298908997.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/claude-code-reinvent:latest

# 3. (If image changed) Update runtime to pick up new image + env vars
make update-runtime-env

# 4. Wait for runtime to be READY (~15-20s)
make get-runtime  # check "status": "READY"

# 5. Create a GitHub issue and trigger the agent
gh issue create --repo KBB99/riv2025-long-horizon-coding-agent-demo \
  --title "[MVP] Canopy Build" \
  --body "Build the Canopy app as specified in BUILD_PLAN.md."
gh api repos/KBB99/riv2025-long-horizon-coding-agent-demo/issues/ISSUE_NUM/reactions -f content=rocket

# 6. Trigger immediately (instead of waiting for 5-min poller)
gh workflow run "Agent Builder" --repo KBB99/riv2025-long-horizon-coding-agent-demo -f issue_number=ISSUE_NUM

# 7. Monitor
gh run list --repo KBB99/riv2025-long-horizon-coding-agent-demo --workflow "Agent Builder" --limit 3
gh api repos/KBB99/riv2025-long-horizon-coding-agent-demo/issues/ISSUE_NUM/comments --jq '.[].body[:200]'
```

### Monitoring the Agent

```bash
# Watch CloudWatch logs (agent subprocess output visible via OTEL)
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name "/aws/bedrock-agentcore/runtimes/claude_code_reinvent-1eBYMO7kHw" \
  --start-time $(python3 -c "import datetime; print(int((datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc) - datetime.timedelta(minutes=5)).timestamp() * 1000))") \
  --region us-east-1 --output json | python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for evt in data.get('events', []):
    try:
        body = json.loads(evt['message']).get('body', '')
        if body and 'agent.entrypoint' in evt['message']:
            print(body[:250])
    except: pass
"

# Check for commits on agent-runtime
gh api "repos/KBB99/riv2025-long-horizon-coding-agent-demo/commits?sha=agent-runtime&per_page=5" \
  --jq '.[] | .sha[:8] + " " + .commit.author.date + " " + (.commit.message | split("\n")[0])'

# Stop a running session
make stop-session SESSION_ID=<session-id-from-issue-comment>
```

### Lessons Learned / Pitfalls

1. **`update-runtime-env` replaces ALL env vars** — if you add a new env var to `launch` but forget to add it to `update-runtime-env` in the Makefile, it gets wiped on the next update. This was the root cause of issues #5-#13 (missing `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`).
2. **`print()` is invisible in CloudWatch** — only Python `logging` module output gets captured by OTEL auto-instrumentation. Use `logger.info()` for anything you need to see.
3. **Docker images must be ARM64** — AgentCore runs on Graviton. Always build with `--platform linux/arm64`.
4. **`bypassPermissions` requires non-root** — the Claude CLI refuses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` when running as root. The Dockerfile creates a non-root `agent` user (UID 1000).
5. **The agent takes 20-30 min before its first commit** — it builds up a large batch of files before committing. The background push loop and post-commit hook handle pushing once commits exist.
6. **Incentives shape agent behavior more than instructions** — saying "graded on UI quality" and "200 tests" caused the agent to skip backend/infra entirely and build a frontend-only app. Replacing grading language with phase-completion scoring fixed the build order immediately (issue #17 vs #14).
7. **Test count suggestions are weak constraints** — asking for "~50 tests" still produced 210+. If strict test count control is needed, it may require enforcement in the harness code rather than the prompt.
8. **CDK `agentCoreRoleName` must match the container's execution role** — The container runs as `claude-code-agentcore-role`, NOT the `AmazonBedrockAgentCoreSDKRuntime-*` role. If you pass the wrong role name to `cdk deploy -c agentCoreRoleName=...`, the Secrets Manager / SSM / CloudWatch policies attach to the wrong role and the container silently crashes (no logs after handler init). The Makefile's `deploy-infra` target now passes the correct defaults automatically.
9. **CDK deploy without `vpcId` creates a new VPC** — The account has a VPC limit. Always pass `-c vpcId=vpc-04be60df8488bb6e5` (or use `make deploy-infra` which does this automatically).

## Architecture

The system is an autonomous coding agent that builds full-stack applications from GitHub issues.

### Execution Flow

```
GitHub Issue (with reaction)
  → issue-poller.yml (detects approved issues)
  → agent-builder.yml (acquires lock, invokes AgentCore)
  → bedrock_entrypoint.py (clones repo, resolves config)
  → claude_code.py (wraps Claude SDK, runs agent session)
  → Claude builds the app, commits to agent-runtime branch
  → deploy-preview.yml (builds and deploys to CloudFront)
```

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bedrock_entrypoint.py` | Main orchestrator. Clones the repo, reads `PROJECT_NAME`, resolves the build plan path, sets up environment, and spawns `claude_code.py` as a subprocess. Handles both GitHub mode (from issues) and legacy mode. |
| `claude_code.py` | Agent session manager. Wraps the Claude Agent SDK. Loads `BUILD_PLAN.md`, system prompts, and example tests. Manages the conversation loop, screenshots, and git operations. |
| `src/github_integration.py` | GitHub API wrapper. Posts comments, manages labels, uploads screenshots, creates/updates issues. |
| `src/git_operations.py` | Git commit and push logic. Handles periodic commits to `agent-runtime` branch. |
| `src/cloudwatch_metrics.py` | Heartbeat metrics for health monitoring. |
| `Makefile` | All management commands: `launch`, `reset`, `deploy-infra`, `show-config`, etc. |
| `infrastructure/lib/claude-code-stack.ts` | CDK stack defining ECR, S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, IAM roles. |

### GitHub Actions Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `issue-poller.yml` | Cron (every 5 min) | Finds approved issues, triggers agent-builder |
| `agent-builder.yml` | `workflow_dispatch` from poller | Invokes Bedrock AgentCore session |
| `deploy-preview.yml` | Push to `agent-runtime` | Builds the generated app and deploys to CloudFront |

## How PROJECT_NAME Works

`PROJECT_NAME` is set in the Makefile (default: `canopy`) and passed as an environment variable through AgentCore to the container.

1. `bedrock_entrypoint.py` reads `os.environ.get("PROJECT_NAME", "canopy")`
2. Passes `--project {project_name}` to `claude_code.py`
3. `claude_code.py` loads files from `prompts/{project_name}/`:
   - `BUILD_PLAN.md` — the full project specification (required)
   - `EXAMPLE_TEST.txt` — example test patterns (optional)
   - `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` — project-specific debugging tips (optional)
   - `system_prompt.txt` — project-specific system prompt (optional)
4. Shared prompts are always loaded from `prompts/`:
   - `system_prompt.txt` — base system prompt
   - `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` — general debugging guide
   - `FRONTEND_AESTHETICS_GUIDE.md` — UI design guidance

### Creating a New Project

1. Create `prompts/{project-name}/BUILD_PLAN.md` with full specification
2. Optionally add `EXAMPLE_TEST.txt`, `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md`, `system_prompt.txt`
3. Rebuild and push the Docker image (prompts are baked into the image — see "Deploying Changes")
4. Launch: `make launch PROJECT_NAME={project-name}`

## Deploying Changes

Changes to agent code (`claude_code.py`, `bedrock_entrypoint.py`, `src/`), prompts (`prompts/`), or the scaffold template require rebuilding and pushing the Docker image. The Dockerfile (`COPY prompts/ ./prompts/`) bakes prompts into the image at `/app/prompts/` — merging to `main` alone does NOT update the running agent.

### Full deployment sequence

```bash
# 1. Deploy CDK infrastructure (if stack resources changed)
make deploy-infra

# 2. Build and push the Docker image to ECR
#    Get the ECR URI from stack outputs:
make show-config   # look for ECR_URI

#    Login, build, push:
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 --profile default | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ECR_URI>
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t <ECR_URI>:latest .
docker push <ECR_URI>:latest

# 3. (Optional) Update runtime env vars if they changed
make update-runtime-env

# 4. Reset agent state for a fresh run
make reset

# 5. Launch a new session (or let issue-poller trigger one)
make launch
```

### What requires an image rebuild

| Change | Rebuild image? | CDK deploy? |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `prompts/` (BUILD_PLAN, system_prompt) | **Yes** | No |
| `claude_code.py`, `bedrock_entrypoint.py` | **Yes** | No |
| `src/*.py` (git_operations, github_integration) | **Yes** | No |
| `frontend-scaffold-template/` | **Yes** | No |
| `infrastructure/lib/claude-code-stack.ts` | No | **Yes** |
| `Makefile` (env var defaults) | No | No (use `make update-runtime-env`) |
| `.github/workflows/` | No | No (picked up from `main` by GitHub Actions) |

## Resetting Agent State

Run `make reset` to wipe everything and start fresh. This:

- Deletes `agent-runtime` branch (local + remote)
- Closes all open issues with `agent-building` label
- Deletes SSM parameters: `/claude-code/current-issue`, `/claude-code/session-id`, `/claude-code/infra/deploy-state`
- Empties S3 screenshots and previews buckets
- Invalidates CloudFront caches

## CDK Context Variables

Pass via `--context key=value` when deploying infrastructure:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `projectName` | `claude-code` | Prefix for all AWS resource names |
| `environment` | `reinvent` | Environment suffix (affects secret paths, stack name) |
| `vpcId` | (creates new) | Use existing VPC instead of creating one |
| `agentCoreRoleName` | (none) | Existing IAM role name for AgentCore |
| `agentRuntimeId` | `YOUR_AGENT_RUNTIME_ID` | AgentCore runtime ID (for log group config) |
| `githubActionsUserName` | (none) | Existing IAM user for GitHub Actions |
| `logRetentionDays` | `7` | CloudWatch log retention period |

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Labels missing
Workflows fail silently if `agent-building`, `agent-complete`, or `tests-failed` labels don't exist. Create them:
```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/labels -f name="agent-building" -f color="FBCA04"
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/labels -f name="agent-complete" -f color="0E8A16"
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/labels -f name="tests-failed" -f color="D93F0B"
```

### deploy-preview can't find dist/
The deploy-preview workflow searches for `dist/` in workspace subdirectories. If the generated app uses a different build output directory, update the find pattern in `.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml`.

### Agent stuck or stale session
If the agent appears stuck, check the SSM parameter `/claude-code/session-id` for the current session. Use `make stop-session SESSION_ID=xxx` to stop it, or `make reset` to clear everything.

### CloudFront returns old content
Run `make reset` which includes CloudFront cache invalidation, or manually invalidate:
```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id DIST_ID --paths "/*"
```

### f-string escaping in SSM instructions
When modifying `bedrock_entrypoint.py`, JSON braces inside f-strings must be double-escaped (`{{` and `}}`). This has been a source of bugs in SSM parameter instructions.
