An autonomous agent system that builds full-stack applications from GitHub issues using AWS Bedrock AgentCore and the Claude Agent SDK.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with Bedrock AgentCore access
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Docker installed locally
- AWS CLI and CDK configured
- `agentcore` CLI installed (`pip install bedrock-agentcore`) — **Note**: the `agentcore launch/push/build` subcommands are broken; use `make` targets instead (see below)

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# 0. Copy and fill in your local config
cp Makefile.local.example Makefile.local
# Edit Makefile.local: set AWS_PROFILE, AWS_REGION, VPC_ID, GITHUB_REPO

# 1. Deploy CDK infrastructure (ECR, S3 buckets, CloudFront, IAM roles)
make deploy-infra

# 2. Build and push the Docker image (ECR URI from: make show-config)
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ECR_URI>
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t <ECR_URI>:latest .
docker push <ECR_URI>:latest

# 3. Create the AgentCore runtime (first time only)
make create-runtime
# Copy the agentRuntimeId from the output into Makefile.local as AGENT_RUNTIME_ID
# Then update the runtime environment:
make update-runtime-env
```

### GitHub Setup

1. **Secrets** (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Secrets):

   | Secret | Description |
   |--------|-------------|
   | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | IAM user access key for GitHub Actions |
   | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | IAM user secret key |
   | `AWS_AGENTCORE_ROLE_ARN` | IAM role ARN for invoking AgentCore (output of CDK deploy) |
   | `AWS_PREVIEW_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` | IAM role ARN for deploying previews (output of CDK deploy) |
   | `AWS_INFRA_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` | IAM role ARN for deploying agent-written CDK infra (output of CDK deploy) |

2. **Variables** (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables):

   | Variable | Description |
   |----------|-------------|
   | `AUTHORIZED_APPROVERS` | Comma-separated GitHub usernames who can approve builds |
   | `AWS_REGION` | AWS region where infrastructure is deployed (e.g. `us-east-1`) |
   | `AGENTCORE_AGENT_ID` | AgentCore runtime ID (from `make create-runtime` output) |
   | `APP_CDK_STACK_NAME` | CDK stack name for agent-generated app (e.g. `canopy-app-stack`) |
   | `PREVIEWS_BUCKET_NAME` | S3 bucket for preview deployments (output of CDK deploy) |
   | `PREVIEWS_CDN_DOMAIN` | CloudFront domain for previews (output of CDK deploy) |
   | `PREVIEWS_DISTRIBUTION_ID` | CloudFront distribution ID for cache invalidation (output of CDK deploy) |

3. **Labels** (must exist for workflows):

   ```bash
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/labels -f name="agent-building" -f color="FBCA04" -f description="Agent is actively working on this issue"
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/labels -f name="agent-complete" -f color="0E8A16" -f description="Agent has completed this issue"
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/labels -f name="tests-failed" -f color="D93F0B" -f description="Tests failed during agent build"
   ```

### AWS Secrets Manager

The agent reads secrets at runtime:

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `claude-code/{env}/anthropic-api-key` | Anthropic API key (not needed if using Bedrock) |
| `claude-code/{env}/github-token` | Default GitHub PAT (fallback) |
| `claude-code/{env}/github-token-{org}` | Org-specific GitHub PAT (optional) |

Where `{env}` is the environment name (default: `reinvent`).

## How It Works

1. **User creates a GitHub issue** with a feature request
2. **Users vote** with reactions to prioritize what gets built
3. **Authorized user approves** by adding a reaction
4. **Issue poller** (runs every 5 min) detects approved issues, sorted by votes
5. **Agent builder** workflow acquires lock and invokes AWS Bedrock AgentCore
6. **Bedrock entrypoint** clones the repo and starts the Claude agent
7. **Agent builds the feature** following the build plan, taking screenshots, running tests
8. **Progress is tracked** via commits pushed to the `agent-runtime` branch
9. **On completion**, the `agent-complete` label is added
10. **Deploy preview** workflow builds and deploys to CloudFront

## Creating a New Project

> **Recommended**: Run `claude` in this repo for an interactive guided setup. Claude will check your prerequisites, help you create a BUILD_PLAN.md, deploy infrastructure, and trigger the agent — all conversationally.

The agent uses `PROJECT_NAME` to find build plans and configure each project. To build something other than the default Canopy app:

### 1. Create a build plan directory

```
prompts/
  myapp/
    BUILD_PLAN.md         # Required: full project specification
    EXAMPLE_TEST.txt      # Optional: example test for the agent to follow
    DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md    # Optional: project-specific debugging tips
```

### 2. Write BUILD_PLAN.md

This is the most important file. It tells the agent exactly what to build. Include:

- **Project overview** — what the app does, who it's for
- **Technology stack** — framework, build tools, styling, backend
- **API specification** — endpoints, request/response schemas
- **Data models** — entities, relationships, database design
- **UI specification** — pages, components, layout
- **Test requirements** — what tests to write, how to run them

See `prompts/canopy/BUILD_PLAN.md` for a complete example.

### 3. Launch with your project name

```bash
# Via make
make launch PROJECT_NAME=myapp

# Or override just the variable
make launch-local PROJECT_NAME=myapp
```

### What PROJECT_NAME controls

- `prompts/{PROJECT_NAME}/BUILD_PLAN.md` is loaded as the build plan
- `prompts/{PROJECT_NAME}/EXAMPLE_TEST.txt` is loaded as test guidance
- `prompts/{PROJECT_NAME}/DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` is loaded for debugging context
- Shared prompts in `prompts/system_prompt.txt` and `prompts/DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` are always loaded

## Resetting the Agent

To wipe all agent state and start fresh:

```bash
make reset
```

This performs the following:

1. **Deletes the `agent-runtime` branch** (local and remote) — removes all generated code
2. **Closes all open issues** with the `agent-building` label
3. **Clears SSM parameters** — `/claude-code/current-issue`, `/claude-code/session-id`, `/claude-code/infra/deploy-state`
4. **Empties S3 buckets** — screenshots and previews
5. **Invalidates CloudFront caches** — ensures stale content is purged

After reset, create a new GitHub issue and add a reaction to trigger a fresh build.

## Configuration

Override any variable on the command line:

```bash
make launch PROJECT_NAME=myapp SESSION_DURATION_HOURS=2.0 DEFAULT_MODEL=us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1
```

Key variables (set in `Makefile` or via environment):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PROJECT_NAME` | `canopy` | Which build plan to use (`prompts/{name}/`) |
| `DEFAULT_MODEL` | `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1` | Bedrock model ID |
| `SESSION_DURATION_HOURS` | `7.0` | Max agent session length |
| `PUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `300` | How often to push commits |
| `SCREENSHOT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `300` | How often to capture screenshots |
| `AWS_PROFILE` | `default` | AWS CLI profile |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | AWS region |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | _(set in Makefile.local)_ | Target GitHub repo (owner/repo) |

Run `make show-config` to see all current values.
