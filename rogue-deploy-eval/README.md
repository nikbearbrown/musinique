# A toy evaluation of inference code tampering

This is the code for [this blog post](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2024/rogue-eval/).

This allows running a semi-quantitative evaluation of a model's ability to write code that modifies a simple generation function to disable the generation monitor while solving another task.

## How to use this code

To run the experiment

1. Fill the places in the repository that are 'TO_FILL', as our experiments relied on private tools for GPU code execution and LLM inference.

2. Run the notebook `rogue_deploy/simple_pipeline.py`

3. Run the notebook `rogue_deploy/print_pipeline.py`
