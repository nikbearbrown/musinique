"""Create the scheduled deployment (weekday mornings, 9 AM Eastern), or bring an
existing one up to date.

The agent, environment, and vault IDs come from claude-lock.json, which
`ant apply` wrote; the Sentry org and project come from .env and go into the
message that starts each run. The first run appends CLAUDE_DEPLOYMENT_ID to
.env. After that, running this again (./agents/setup.sh does) re-pins the
deployment to the latest agent version and re-sends the environment, vault,
and message, because a deployment keeps whatever it was created with.
