     * Input messages.
     *
     * Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns.
     * When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages`
     * parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive
     * `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.
     *
     * Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single
     * `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.
     *
     * If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue
     * immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the
     * model's response.
     *
     * Example with a single `user` message:
     * ```json
     * [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
     * ```
     *
     * Example with multiple conversational turns:
     * ```json
     * [
     *   {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
     *   {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
     *   {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
     * ]
     * ```
     *
     * Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:
     * ```json
     * [
     *   {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
     *   {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
     * ]
     * ```
     *
     * Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks,
     * where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an
     * array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:
     * ```json
     * {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
     * ```
     * ```json
     * {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}

     * There are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior described

     * [server tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools),

     *   shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.
     *
     * For example, if you defined `tools` as:
     * ```json
     * [
     *   {
     *     "name": "get_stock_price",
     *     "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",

     *     }
     *   }
     * ]
     * ```
     *
     * And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use`
     * content blocks in the response like this:
     * ```json
     * [
     *   {
     *     "type": "tool_use",
     *     "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",

     *     "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
     *   }
     * ]
     * ```
     *
     * You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and
     * return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:
     * ```json
     * [
     *   {
     *     "type": "tool_result",
     *     "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
     *     "content": "259.75 USD"
     *   }
     * ]
     * ```

         * `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the
         * conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined
         * into a single turn.
         *
         * Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a
         * single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.
         *
         * If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue
         * immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the
         * model's response.
         *
         * Example with a single `user` message:
         * ```json
         * [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
         * ```
         *
         * Example with multiple conversational turns:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
         *   {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
         *   {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
         *   {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content
         * blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is
         * shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input
         * messages are equivalent:
         * ```json
         * {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}

         * the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the
         * model using `tool_result` content blocks.
         *
         * There are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior
         * described below applies to client tools. For
         * [server tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools),
         * see their individual documentation as each has its own behavior (e.g., the
         * [web search tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).
         *
         * Each tool definition includes:
         * * `name`: Name of the tool.
         * * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
         * * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool
         *   `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.
         *
         * For example, if you defined `tools` as:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {
         *     "name": "get_stock_price",
         *     "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
         *     "input_schema": {
         *       "type": "object",
         *       "properties": {
         *         "ticker": {
         *           "type": "string",
         *           "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
         *         }
         *       },
         *       "required": ["ticker"]
         *     }
         *   }
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
         * `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {
         *     "type": "tool_use",
         *     "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
         *     "name": "get_stock_price",
         *     "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
         *   }
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input,
         * and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {
         *     "type": "tool_result",
         *     "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
         *     "content": "259.75 USD"
         *   }
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or
         * more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of
         * output.

         * Input messages.
         *
         * Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational
         * turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the
         * `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the
         * conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined
         * into a single turn.
         *
         * Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a
         * single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.
         *
         * If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue
         * immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the
         * model's response.
         *
         * Example with a single `user` message:
         * ```json
         * [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
         * ```
         *
         * Example with multiple conversational turns:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
         *   {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
         *   {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
         *   {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content
         * blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is
         * shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input
         * messages are equivalent:
         * ```json
         * {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
         * ```
         * ```json

         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input,

             * Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
             * conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
             * conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the
             * next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your
             * request will be combined into a single turn.
             *
             * Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a
             * single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant`
             * messages.
             *
             * If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue
             * immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of
             * the model's response.
             *
             * Example with a single `user` message:
             * ```json
             * [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
             * ```
             *
             * Example with multiple conversational turns:
             * ```json
             * [
             *   {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
             *   {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
             *   {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
             * ]
             * ```
             *
             * Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:
             * ```json
             * [
             *   {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
             *   {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
             * ]
             * ```
             *
             * Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content
             * blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is
             * shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input
             * messages are equivalent:
             * ```json
             * {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
             * ```

             * * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.

             *   `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.
             *
             * For example, if you defined `tools` as:
             * ```json
             * [

             * ]
             * ```
             *
             * And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
             * `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:
             * ```json
             * [
             *   {
             *     "type": "tool_use",

             *   }
             * ]
             * ```
             *
             * You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
             * input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:
             * ```json
             * [
