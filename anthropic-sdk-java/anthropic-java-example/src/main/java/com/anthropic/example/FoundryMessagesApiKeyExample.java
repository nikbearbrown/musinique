/**
 * <p>
 * An example of retrieving messages from an Anthropic model running on the Microsoft Foundry
 * backend using an API key for authorization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use the {@link FoundryBackend}, the SDK module for Foundry must be added to the dependencies.
 * Many of the other examples can be adapted to create a client with the {@code FoundryBackend}.
 * Once a client is created, the rest of the code does not need to be changed (subject to the
 * endpoint being supported). See the SDK documentation for details on dependencies and endpoint
 * support for Foundry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An Entra ID token supplier or an API key must be configured to access Microsoft Foundry. This
 * example resolves the required API key automatically from an environment variable. Alternatively,
 * a bearer token supplier and resource (or base URL) can be provided explicitly. See
 * {@link FoundryMessagesBearerTokenExample} for comparison.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To run this example, set the following environment variables which will be accessed via
 * {@code FoundryBackend.fromEnv()}:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_API_KEY}:
 *       The API key authorizing access to the service.</li>
 *   <li>{@code ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_RESOURCE}:
 *       The name of the Foundry resource hosting the service.</li>
 * </ul>
