/**
 * The Microsoft Foundry backend that manages the API key or bearer token supplier (e.g., Entra ID
 * credentials) and other information required to access an Anthropic AI model on Microsoft Foundry
 * and adapts requests to Foundry's requirements.
 *
 * Microsoft Foundry requires authentication credentials issued by Microsoft. These can be provided
 * via environment variables or directly to the [Builder]. The default environment variable API key
 * credentials can be resolved by calling [Builder.fromEnv]. For other sources of the credentials,
 * resolve them separately and provide them to [Builder.apiKey] or [Builder.bearerTokenSupplier].
