# claude-tag-plugins

Plugins for [@claude](https://claude.ai) that connect the agent to common SaaS services.
Each service is its own plugin, so a workspace can connect exactly the services it uses.

## Getting Started

### Claude Tag

```bash
# Add the marketplace first
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-tag-plugins

# Install the services you use
claude plugin install jira@claude-tag-plugins
claude plugin install datadog@claude-tag-plugins
```

Once installed, skills activate automatically when relevant.

## How It Works

Each service plugin follows the same structure:

```
<service>/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Manifest
└── skills/<service>-api/
    ├── SKILL.md                 # How to connect and core operations
    ├── references/              # Full endpoint catalog, read on demand
    └── scripts/                 # Executable helpers (where present)
```

The two helper plugins use the same `skills/<name>/` layout but carry different
content: [`claude-tag-data-viz`](./claude-tag-data-viz) ships a Python charting
kit instead of curl scripts, and [`claude-tag-troubleshoot`](./claude-tag-troubleshoot)
ships a slash command plus two documentation-only skills.

## Authentication

Plugins contain **no auth setup instructions** — authentication is handled by the runtime.
Credentials are injected into outbound requests; the environment variables each plugin
references (`$DD_API_KEY`, `$ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`, `$BQ_TOKEN`, ...) exist only to keep requests
well-formed and may hold placeholder values.

## Security Considerations

The bundled scripts use `Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}` headers. When run **outside** the
credential-injecting runtime (e.g. local development or CI without secrets configured), the
token variable will be unset or hold a placeholder — requests will be rejected with `401`.
Never commit real credentials; configure them through your runtime's secret injection
mechanism. To report a security vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
