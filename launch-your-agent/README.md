# launch-your-agent

A [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) skill that helps a technical founder build whatever they want on **Claude Managed Agents (CMA)** — an internal worker, a piece of their product, a customer-facing agent. It interviews you about what you want to build, scopes a v0, launches it in your own account, grades it against your own definition of done, iterates, and (if it should run on a clock) puts it on a scheduled deployment — with everything bigger laid out as an explicit v1/v2 plan.

> This is an educational skill that walks you through composing managed-agent primitives to solve your problem. Because it explains each step, it's more token-intensive than a purpose-built agent would be.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/launch-your-agent.git
cd launch-your-agent
claude
```

Then type:

```
/launch-your-agent
```

The skills in `.claude/skills/` are picked up automatically when you run Claude Code inside this folder — nothing to install.

When you're done (or any time later), `/wrap-up` refreshes the overview page, recaps every primitive you now own, and suggests the next 1–2 upgrades.

## What you need

- Claude Code installed and signed in.
- An Anthropic API key for **your own** account (you'll create it during the flow at platform.claude.com → API keys; it goes into a local `.env` file, never into the chat). Runs cost cents.

## What you walk away with

- A live managed agent in your Console (agent + environment + graded run, plus a scheduled deployment if your task recurs).
- A `my-agent/` folder: the build sheet, the exact API payloads, a resumable launch script, an eval scaffold, an overview page, and a NEXT-DIRECTIONS.md laying out v1/v2.

## Repo layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `.claude/skills/launch-your-agent/` | The main skill: 4 phases (interview → stage & launch → grade & iterate → run without you) + references (interview mapping, verified API call shapes, examples bank, overview template) |
| `.claude/skills/wrap-up/` | Companion skill: explicit close-out / status check for a built agent |
| `cma-primitives.md` | Inventory of CMA primitives and limits, from the public docs |
| `interview-to-config.md` | Background: how interview answers map to CMA primitives |
| `examples-bank.md` | Sourced example agents and production proof points |
| `ui/` | Example overview page + build sheet |

The CMA documentation is the source of truth for the API: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/overview
