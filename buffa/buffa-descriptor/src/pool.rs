//! Runtime descriptor pool.
//!
//! [`DescriptorPool`] takes one or more `FileDescriptorProto`s and produces a
//! flat, linked, feature-resolved set of [`MessageDescriptor`]s and
//! [`EnumDescriptor`]s. Cross-references (a field of message type, an enum
//! value type) are resolved to pool-local [`MessageIndex`] / [`EnumIndex`]
//! handles. Edition features (presence, packed, delimited, enum openness) are
//! resolved at build time, so every [`FieldDescriptor`] carries final values
//! and consumers never need to walk a `FeatureSet` chain.
//!
//! Construction is two-pass:
//!
//! 1. **Register**: walk every file, recording the fully-qualified name of
//!    every message and enum (including nested ones) and assigning each a
//!    pool index. This makes forward references and cross-file references
//!    resolvable in the second pass.
//! 2. **Link**: walk every file again, building the linked [`MessageDescriptor`]
//!    for each message: resolving `type_name` strings to indices, classifying
//!    fields as singular / list / map, resolving features down the
//!    file → message → field chain, and validating `u16` field-count limits.
//!
//! The pool retains the original `FileDescriptorProto`s after linking — gRPC
//! server reflection needs the raw bytes, and they're cheap to keep relative
//! to the linked structures.
