//! The [`ReflectMessage`] trait, [`ReflectCow`], and the [`Reflectable`]
//! entry-point trait.
//!
//! `ReflectMessage` is **dyn-safe and storage-agnostic** by design. The
//! v1 implementation is map-backed [`DynamicMessage`](super::DynamicMessage);
//! a future vtable-backed implementation on generated types must slot in as
//! a *second* impl of the same trait, with no call-site changes. That
//! constraint dictates the signature shape:
//!
//! - Accessors take `&FieldDescriptor`, not a generic key — the vtable will
//!   index directly off the descriptor, the map will look up by number.
//! - Accessors return [`ValueRef<'_>`], not an associated type — both impls
//!   produce the same enum.
//! - `for_each_set` takes `&mut dyn FnMut`, not `impl FnMut` — `dyn` traits
//!   can't have generic methods.
//!
//! [`Reflectable`] is the codegen-emitted entry point: every generated message
//! gets an impl whenever any reflection is enabled, and the body varies by
//! [`ReflectMode`](super::ReflectMode). The call site is always
//! `foo.reflect().get(fd)`; bridge mode pays an encode/decode round-trip,
//! vtable mode is zero-cost. Flipping a message between modes requires no
//! diff at the call site.
