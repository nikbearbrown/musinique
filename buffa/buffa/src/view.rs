//! Zero-copy borrowed message views.
//!
//! Buffa generates two representations for each protobuf message:
//!
//! - **Owned** (`MyMessage`): uses `String`, `Vec<u8>`, `Vec<T>` for fields.
//!   Suitable for building messages, long-lived storage, and mutation.
//!
//! - **Borrowed** (`MyMessageView<'a>`): uses `&'a str`, `&'a [u8]`, and
//!   slice-backed repeated fields. Borrows directly from the input buffer
//!   for zero-copy deserialization on the read path.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! In a typical RPC handler, the request is parsed from a buffer, fields are
//! read, and the buffer is discarded. With owned types, every string and bytes
//! field requires an allocation + copy. With view types, strings and bytes
//! borrow directly from the input buffer — no allocation at all.
//!
//! This is analogous to how Cap'n Proto's Rust implementation works, and how
//! Go achieves zero-copy string deserialization via its garbage collector.
//!
//! # Usage pattern
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Decode a view (zero-copy, borrows from `wire_bytes`)
//! let request = MyRequestView::decode_view(&wire_bytes)?;
//! println!("name: {}", request.name);  // &str, no allocation
//!
//! // Build an owned response
//! let response = MyResponse {
//!     id: request.id,
//!     status: "ok".into(),
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//!
//! // Convert view to owned if needed for storage
//! let owned: MyRequest = request.to_owned_message()?;
//! ```
//!
//! # Reborrowing from `OwnedView`
//!
//! [`OwnedView<V>`](OwnedView) wraps a decoded view with the lifetime erased
//! to `'static`. The inner view is reached through
//! [`OwnedView::reborrow`], which ties the borrow to the `OwnedView` itself —
//! field reads, assigning the view to a binding, passing it to a function
//! with a non-`'static` lifetime parameter, and returning a borrowed field
//! all go through the same call:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use buffa::view::OwnedView;
//! # use buffa::__doctest_fixtures::PersonView;
//! // reborrow ties the returned borrow to the OwnedView's lifetime.
//! fn handler<'a>(req: &'a OwnedView<PersonView<'static>>) -> &'a str {
//!     req.reborrow().name
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The view is deliberately not exposed as `&V` (e.g. via `Deref`): `V` is
//! `FooView<'static>`, so its borrowed fields would *appear* `'static` to the
//! compiler and could outlive the buffer they point into. `reborrow` narrows
//! that synthetic `'static` down to the `OwnedView`'s real lifetime. Generated
//! code also provides a per-message `FooOwnedView` wrapper with field accessor
//! methods, so handler code rarely needs to call `reborrow` directly. See
//! [`OwnedView`] for details.
//!
//! The same synthetic `'static` is what `V::decode_view` sees, so every
//! `OwnedView` constructor requires `V: `[`ViewLifetimeParametric`] — the
//! `unsafe` marker asserting that no impl on `V` can let a borrow of that
//! buffer outlive the view. Codegen emits it for every generated view;
//! hand-written views opt in with an explicit `unsafe impl`.
//!
//! # Generated code shape
//!
//! For a message like:
//! ```protobuf
//! message Person {
//!   string name = 1;
//!   int32 id = 2;
//!   bytes avatar = 3;
//!   repeated string tags = 4;
//!   Address address = 5;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Buffa generates:
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Owned type (heap-allocated strings and vecs)
//! pub struct Person {
//!     pub name: String,
//!     pub id: i32,
//!     pub avatar: Vec<u8>,
//!     pub tags: Vec<String>,
//!     pub address: MessageField<Address>,
//!     #[doc(hidden)] pub __buffa_unknown_fields: UnknownFields,
//! }
//!
//! // Borrowed view type (zero-copy from input buffer)
//! pub struct PersonView<'a> {
//!     pub name: &'a str,
//!     pub id: i32,
//!     pub avatar: &'a [u8],
//!     pub tags: RepeatedView<'a, &'a str>,
//!     pub address: MessageFieldView<AddressView<'a>>,
//!     pub __buffa_unknown_fields: UnknownFieldsView<'a>,

///   `Reborrowed<'b>` must be `Self` with its buffer lifetime replaced by
///   `'b`, exposing no buffer borrow longer than `'b`. (A `MessageView`
///   impl that is generic over a *second* lifetime can satisfy the GAT's
///   `MessageView<'b>` bound with `Reborrowed<'b> = Self`, which would let
///   [`OwnedView::reborrow`] hand out `'static` borrows.)
///
/// After `OwnedView`'s reborrow routing, three impls on `V` observe the
/// forged `'static`: the `MessageView<'static>` decode entry points
/// (`decode_view` / `decode_view_with_ctx` and what they call), `Clone`, and
/// [`ViewReborrow::reborrow`] itself, which receives `&'b MyView<'static>`
/// before shortening it. `Debug`, `PartialEq`, `Serialize` and
/// `to_owned_message` run on `Reborrowed<'b>` at the real lifetime; a
/// lifetime-generic view's `Drop` cannot be specialised to `'static` (Rust
/// requires a `Drop` impl to be as generic as the type), so it is parametric
/// by construction; and `MessageView::Owned` is `'static` (`Message:
/// DefaultInstance: 'static`), so `to_owned_message` cannot smuggle a borrow
/// out through the owned type. An audit of a hand-written view therefore
/// reduces to: is `decode_view*` parametric (written for `impl<'a>
/// MessageView<'a>`), is `Clone` derived or parametric, and is `reborrow` the
/// canonical [`impl_view_reborrow!`] body (`{ this }`), which retains nothing?
///
/// The trait is implemented for the `'static` instantiation
/// (`MyView<'static>`) because that is the type `OwnedView` stores, but the
/// assertion is about the type constructor `MyView<'_>` and every impl on
/// it. Prior art: `yoke::Yokeable` is an `unsafe` trait carrying the same
/// covariance-and-no-capture obligation for the same reason.
///
/// The simplest way to satisfy this is the way generated code does: make
/// the view struct generic over the buffer lifetime (`MyView<'a>`), every
/// impl other than `ViewReborrow` parametric in it
/// (`impl<'a> MessageView<'a> for MyView<'a>`,
/// `impl<'a> Debug for MyView<'a>`, …), and `ViewReborrow` the canonical
/// [`impl_view_reborrow!`] shape. Parametric code cannot observe that
/// `'a = 'static`, so the borrow checker itself prevents it from smuggling
/// a borrow past `Self`'s lifetime. An impl written only for `'static`
/// (`impl MessageView<'static> for MyView`) may be marked only if the view
/// holds no borrows from the buffer at all.
///
/// # Example
///
/// A parametric hand-written view opts in with an `unsafe impl` (the
/// `SAFETY` comment is the argument above):
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// // SAFETY: `MyView<'a>` is generic over `'a`; every impl on it other than

///
/// This type is `Send + Sync + 'static`, making it suitable for use across

///
/// # When to use
///
/// Use `OwnedView` when you need a zero-copy view that outlives the scope
/// where the buffer was received — for example, in an RPC handler where the
/// framework requires `'static` types:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use buffa::view::OwnedView;
/// use bytes::Bytes;
///
/// let bytes: Bytes = receive_request_body().await;
/// let view = OwnedView::<PersonView>::decode(bytes)?;
///
/// // Field access through reborrow — the borrow is tied to `view`.
/// let person = view.reborrow();
/// println!("name: {}", person.name);
/// println!("id: {}", person.id);
///
/// // Convert to owned if you need to store or mutate — infallible, since
/// // an OwnedView always holds a wire-decoded view.
/// let owned: Person = view.to_owned_message();
/// ```
///
/// Generated code additionally provides a per-message `FooOwnedView` wrapper
/// around `OwnedView<FooView<'static>>` with per-field accessor methods
/// (`owned.name()`, `owned.id()`, …), so most handler code never touches
/// `OwnedView` or `reborrow` directly.
///
/// For scoped access where the buffer's lifetime is known, use
/// [`MessageView::decode_view`] directly — it has zero overhead beyond the
/// decode itself.
///
/// # Why field access goes through `reborrow`
///
/// `OwnedView` stores `V = FooView<'static>`: the view's borrows really point
/// into `self`'s [`Bytes`] buffer, and the `'static` is a synthetic lifetime
/// established by the constructor. Exposing `&V` directly (for example via a
/// `Deref` impl) would let borrowed fields *appear* `'static` to the
/// compiler and escape the `OwnedView`'s scope, dangling once it drops.
/// [`reborrow()`](OwnedView::reborrow) narrows the synthetic `'static` down
/// to the `OwnedView`'s real lifetime, so the borrow checker enforces the
/// actual validity of every field borrow:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use buffa::view::OwnedView;
/// # use buffa::__doctest_fixtures::PersonView;
/// // Inline reads: reborrow once, then use plain field access.
/// fn log(owned: &OwnedView<PersonView<'static>>) {
///     let person = owned.reborrow();
///     println!("{}", person.name);
/// }
///
/// // Returning a borrowed field: the result is tied to the OwnedView.
/// fn name<'a>(owned: &'a OwnedView<PersonView<'static>>) -> &'a str {
///     owned.reborrow().name  // &'a str tied to the OwnedView's lifetime
/// }
/// ```
///
/// View fields are not reachable directly on the handle — this fails to
/// compile rather than handing out a `'static` borrow into the buffer:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0609
/// # use buffa::view::OwnedView;
/// # use buffa::__doctest_fixtures::PersonView;
/// fn field(owned: &OwnedView<PersonView<'static>>) -> &'static str {
///     owned.name // error[E0609]: no field `name` on type `&OwnedView<...>`
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Internally, `OwnedView` extends the view's lifetime to `'static` via
/// `transmute` in its constructors. This is sound because:
///
/// 1. [`Bytes`] is reference-counted — its heap data pointer is stable across
///    moves. The view's borrows always point into valid memory.
/// 2. [`Bytes`] is immutable — the underlying data cannot be modified while
///    borrowed.
/// 3. The view is declared before the buffer, and the compiler's drop glue
///    drops fields in declaration order, so the view is always gone before
///    the buffer it borrows from is released — on a normal drop and during
///    an unwind; [`into_bytes`](OwnedView::into_bytes) drops it explicitly
///    before handing the buffer back.
