/// rest of your code uses the natural Rust type. If you just want a message
/// type, **write a `.proto` file instead.**
///
/// Manual implementation is intentionally high-friction:
/// - You must correctly implement the two-pass serialization contract
///   (`compute_size` populates the [`SizeCache`](crate::SizeCache) in the
///   same traversal order that `write_to` consumes it).
/// - You must implement wire-format decoding in `merge_field`.
/// - You must implement the [`DefaultInstance`] supertrait, which provides
///   the lazily-initialized static default that [`MessageField`](crate::MessageField)
///   dereferences to when unset.
///
/// If you still need to do this, see the [custom types section of the
/// user guide](https://github.com/anthropics/buffa/blob/main/docs/guide.md#custom-type-implementations)

/// # Serialization model
///
/// Serialization is a two-pass process to avoid the exponential-time problem
/// that affects prost with deeply nested messages:
///
/// 1. **`compute_size()`** — walks the message tree and records the encoded
///    size of every length-delimited sub-message in a [`SizeCache`].
/// 2. **`write_to()`** — walks the tree again, writing bytes and consuming
///    cached sizes for length-prefixed sub-messages.
///
/// The provided [`encode`](Self::encode) method performs both passes with a
/// fresh [`SizeCache`] — most callers use that and never touch the cache
/// directly. `compute_size` / `write_to` take the cache explicitly so that
/// manual `Message` implementations can thread it through nested-message
/// recursion.
///
/// # Thread safety
///
/// `Message` requires `Send + Sync`. Generated structs contain no interior
/// mutability — serialization state lives in the external [`SizeCache`], not
/// in the message — so messages can be placed in an `Arc` and shared across
/// threads freely. `merge` requires `&mut self`, so mutation is exclusive.
///
/// # Struct evolution policy
///
/// Generated message structs (and their [`MessageView`](crate::MessageView) /
/// [`LazyMessageView`](crate::LazyMessageView) counterparts) may gain fields
/// across releases — both when the source `.proto` schema evolves and when
/// buffa adds internal bookkeeping such as `__buffa_unknown_fields` or the
/// required-field presence bitmaps. **Exhaustive struct literals and
/// exhaustive destructuring patterns are not covered by buffa's semver
/// guarantees**: code that names every field will fail to compile when a field
/// is added, and that breakage is not considered a breaking change.
///
/// The forward-compatible ways to construct a generated struct are:
///
/// - decode it from bytes;
/// - struct-update syntax over the default: `Foo { x, y, ..Default::default() }`;
/// - start from `Foo::default()` and assign fields (or call generated `with_*`
///   setters when `generate_with_setters` is enabled).
