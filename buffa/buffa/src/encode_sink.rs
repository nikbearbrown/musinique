//! Output abstraction for message encoding.
//!
//! [`EncodeSink`] is the byte sink every encode path writes into. Its four
//! required methods are the [`BufMut`] primitives the encoders bottom out
//! in (the fixed-width signed/float writers are provided on top), plus
//! [`put_shared`](EncodeSink::put_shared) for splicing an owned [`Bytes`]
//! segment into the output without copying it.
//!
//! Every [`BufMut`] implementor is an `EncodeSink` through a blanket impl,
//! with `put_shared` copying. [`Rope`] implements the trait directly (it is deliberately
//! *not* a `BufMut`) and captures large segments by reference count instead,
//! so encoding a message whose dominant content is one large `bytes` field
//! costs O(everything-but-the-payload) rather than O(payload).
//!
//! # One `write_to` instance per message
//!
//! `Message::write_to` is generic over the sink, so a program that encodes
//! into a `Vec<u8>` in one place and a `BytesMut` in another would compile
//! two copies of every message's `write_to`. The provided encode methods of
//! [`Message`](crate::Message) and [`ViewEncode`](crate::ViewEncode)
//! (`encode`, `encode_to_vec`, and their `try_`, `_with_cache`, bounded and
//! length-delimited variants) therefore write every [`BufMut`] through one
//! shared, pre-sized cursor. They compute the exact size first and ask the
//! sink for that many contiguous bytes: `Vec<u8>` and `BytesMut` offer
//! their spare capacity, and `write_to` fills it with stores that are
//! bounds-checked but never grow the sink. A sink whose current chunk is
//! shorter than the message (an empty `Vec::new()` or `BytesMut::new()`
//! offers 64 bytes, and a chain of buffers offers its first) is filled
//! through a scratch `Vec` of the exact size and appended with one
//! [`put_slice`](EncodeSink::put_slice), so reserving
//! [`encoded_len`](crate::Message::encoded_len) bytes first avoids the
//! extra allocation and copy. The length prefix of
//! `encode_length_delimited` is written to the sink before the message, so
//! reserve up to five bytes more for it.
//!
//! A type that implements `EncodeSink` and not `BufMut`, and a segmented
//! sink ([`IS_SEGMENTED`](EncodeSink::IS_SEGMENTED), such as [`Rope`]),
//! receives every write individually through its own instantiation of
//! `write_to`.
//! Generated lazy views and `DynamicMessage` have their own encode methods,
//! which do not use the shared cursor.

/// call order — the encoders rely on the sink being strictly sequential —
/// and receives every write individually.
///
/// # Contiguous callers
///
/// The blanket impl's `put_shared` copies. The encode entry points write a
/// `BufMut` through its `chunk_mut` and `advance_mut` rather than through
/// `put_slice` and `put_u8` (see the [module documentation](self)), with
/// two consequences:
///
/// - A `write_to` that produces more bytes than its `compute_size`
///   declared panics.
/// - A `BufMut` wrapper that observes bytes in its own `put_*` overrides,
///   such as a checksum or a tee, does not see them individually: it sees
///   `advance_mut` when the message fits its chunk and one `put_slice`
///   otherwise. Observe them in `advance_mut`, or implement `EncodeSink`
///   and not `BufMut`.
///
/// # Method-name overlap with `BufMut`
