//! External size cache for linear-time serialization.
//!
//! Protobuf's wire format requires knowing the encoded size of a sub-message
//! before writing it (for the length-delimited prefix). Without caching, each
//! nesting level recomputes all sizes below it — O(depth²) for chains,
//! exponential for branchy trees. prost has this problem.
//!
//! `SizeCache` records sub-message sizes in a `Vec<u32>` indexed by
//! pre-order DFS traversal, populated by `compute_size` and consumed in the
//! same order by `write_to`. Both passes are O(n).
//!
//! The cache is external to message structs — generated types hold no
//! serialization state, so `let Msg { a, b, .. } = m;` is not forced by
//! hidden plumbing fields. A fresh `SizeCache` is constructed inside the
//! provided `Message::encode*` / `ViewEncode::encode*` methods; manual
//! implementers thread it through their `compute_size` / `write_to`.
//!
//! # Traversal-order invariant
//!
//! `reserve`/`set` calls during `compute_size` must occur in the same
//! order as `consume_next` calls during `write_to`. Generated code guarantees
//! this by iterating fields identically in both functions and by guarding
//! both with identical presence checks (both take `&self`, so the message
//! is immutable between passes). Manual `Message` implementations must
//! uphold the same ordering.

/// [`clear`](Self::clear). `consume_next` only reads a slot after checking

/// or read a wrong-but-initialized size — never undefined behavior.
///
/// # Panic locations
///
/// Generated code calls [`set`](Self::set) once per length-delimited
/// sub-message field and [`consume_next`](Self::consume_next) once as well, so

/// *every* encode. Routing those through a pool reuses one allocation instead.
///
/// ## vs. reusing a single [`SizeCache`]
///
/// For plain sequential reuse you don't strictly need a pool: hold one
/// [`SizeCache`] and call [`encode_with_cache`](crate::Message::encode_with_cache)
/// with [`clear`](SizeCache::clear) between encodes. The pool adds two things
/// that bare reuse cannot: it **shrinks an oversized buffer back on return**
/// (`max_capacity`), so one giant message does not pin peak memory for the
/// lifetime of the cache, and it supports **multiple caches checked out at once**
/// (`max_buffers`), so re-entrant or nested encodes each get their own buffer.
/// If neither matters, a single reused `SizeCache` is simpler.
///
/// # Bring your own — buffa holds no global state
///
/// You own the pool and decide its scope and lifetime: keep one in a
/// `thread_local!` for implicit per-thread reuse, or in a request/connection
/// context for reuse that is freed at that boundary. Only the spill `Vec` is
/// pooled; each cache's inline storage stays on the stack, so routing a *small*
/// message through the pool is just a `Vec` pop/push of an empty buffer — no
/// allocation, no thread-local access, no synchronization. The pool is
/// `alloc`-only, so it works in `no_std` builds.
///
/// # Bounds
///
/// Two limits keep memory in check, both set at construction:
///
/// - `max_buffers` — how many spill buffers the free-list retains. `1` suffices
///   for sequential reuse (one cache in flight at a time, e.g. a `thread_local!`
///   pool — see [`sequential`](Self::sequential)); raise it only for re-entrant
///   or nested encodes that hold several caches at once.
/// - `max_capacity` — the cap, in **`u32` slots**, on each retained buffer's
///   capacity. One slot holds one nested sub-message's size; the first 16 are
///   inline-free, so `max_capacity = N` retains up to `N * 4` bytes per buffer
///   and keeps the allocation warm for messages with up to `N + 16` nested
///   sub-messages. Set it at or above your steady-state spill size — below it,
///   every encode regrows the buffer and `release` shrinks it back, which is worse
///   than not pooling. A few hundred is a sensible starting point.
///
/// Passing `0` for either bound disables retention (the pool then always
/// allocates a fresh cache per `acquire`).
///
