# Release annotations

Why the numbers in [REPORT.md](REPORT.md) move. The data is a **dense,
per-message-isolated, layout-normalized matrix**: every message shape is measured
against every release (v0.1.0–v0.9.0), each built with only its own decoder
compiled, at the pinned toolchain (1.96.0), `lto=true, codegen-units=1`, and
**64-byte block and loop alignment** (`-Cllvm-args=-align-all-nofallthru-blocks=6
-Cllvm-args=-align-loops=64`), measured **1-up** — one benchmark process pinned to
one core with the box otherwise idle — as the median of 3 runs. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the system and [README.md](README.md)
for the mechanics. Each release's harness lives on its `historical-benchmark/vX.Y.Z`
branch, so any cell is rebuildable.

Two effects are controlled. **Per-message isolation** removes cross-message inliner
coupling, so one shape's benchmark can no longer perturb another's. **Block
alignment** removes the build-time code-layout lottery that otherwise dominated the
layout-sensitive operations — see "Layout normalization" below for why it was
needed and what it costs. With both controlled, the cross-release curves are
attributable to buffa's own per-shape encode/decode code, and the whole matrix is
readable at one trust threshold rather than a different one per operation.

The charts shade a **±5% band** around each message's baseline as the typical
run-to-run floor. After normalization the cross-release spread is ~4% overall, so a
line that stays inside the band is noise; movements that clear it are discussed
below. The per-operation "Measurement spread" table in [REPORT.md](REPORT.md) and
the per-benchmark spread in `runs/*.json` remain the place to check how far a given
number can be trusted.

## Headline cross-release findings (v0.1.0 → v0.8.0)

A movement counts as real if it is large *for its operation* and **persists** across
releases. Three findings stand, each now sitting on a clean, flat baseline:

- **`decode_view` +17–21% on string-heavy shapes at v0.8.0** — LogRecord 1429→1670,
  AnalyticsEvent 205→249 MiB/s. This is the `fast-utf8` default landing: UTF-8
  validation in `borrow_str` switched from `core::str::from_utf8` to
  `smoothutf8::verify_with_slack`, which skips the per-string tail copy whenever
  the wire buffer continues past the field. ApiResponse `decode_view` is flat under
  isolation (the strings there are dominated by other field kinds), and MediaFrame
  is +3% (bytes-dominated; little string work). The owned `decode`/`merge` paths
  move less because the same validation is a smaller fraction of cycles once
  per-field allocation enters.
- **AnalyticsEvent `encode` −12% / `compute_size` −9%** — a real regression. A step
  down at v0.4.0 (encode 468→414, compute_size 1379→1262 MiB/s) that holds flat
  through v0.9.0. `compute_size` is the tightest operation and corroborates the
  `encode` figure, so the deeply nested, repeated-submessage shape genuinely lost
  ground on the owned encode/size paths — the one result worth investigating.
- **PackedTile `decode_view` +47% at v0.7.1** — flat (~175 MiB/s) from v0.1.0
  through v0.7.0, then a single-release jump to ~257 at v0.7.1, consistent with the
  packed-varint reserve work in that release; v0.8.0 confirms the step persists.

Everything else is flat across the nine releases — including all of `json_encode` /
`json_decode`, which now hold steady at their fast value (LogRecord `json_encode`
~880 MiB/s at every release, vs a 19% flap before normalization). buffa's core
paths did not regress; the reassuring headline is that nine releases of `decode`,
`merge`, and the JSON paths hold steady once layout is controlled.

## The v0.9.0 re-measurement: 1-up, and two shapes backported (2026-07)

The whole matrix was re-measured for v0.9.0, rather than a column being appended,
for two reasons. Both changed the numbers, so no cell here is comparable to a
chart published before this date.

**Measurement moved from 32-way self-concurrent to 1-up.** Earlier runs measured a
release by running 32 copies of a shape's binary at once, one per physical core,
and taking the median — 32 samples for the price of one wall-clock pass. Measuring
the same v0.8.0 binaries one at a time, on a pinned core with the rest of the box
idle, showed that convenience was not free: throughput came out **higher on 41 of
42 benchmarks, median +5.9%**, and the effect tracks memory pressure exactly as
contention would predict — `media_frame/json_encode`, the largest dataset and the
most allocation-heavy operation, gained **+44.7%**. Self-concurrency was not merely
noisier, it was biased downward, and the bias was uneven across shapes, which is
worse than a constant offset because it distorts *comparisons between shapes*.

Precision improved at the same time, despite dropping from 32 samples to 3:
spread went from p50 3.59% / p90 8.31% to **p50 0.76% / p90 4.93%**. Parallelism
now comes from running several machines rather than several cores of one machine
(`run-series.sh --boxes N`), which keeps each measurement 1-up.

**`mesh` and `column_batch` were backported to every release.** Both shapes were
added to the suite long after most of these releases shipped. Because the harness
belongs to the tooling rather than to any release, they could be measured back
across the whole history, and doing so changed the story of v0.9.0's decode work
substantially — the packed-decode changes read as roughly +32% on `packed_tile`,
the short-array shape that existed at the time, and as **+113% on
`column_batch/decode`** and **+124% on `column_batch/merge`**, the long-column
shape they were actually written for. Judging that work on the shapes we happened
to be tracking when it landed would have understated it by a factor of three.

### An unresolved regression: view decode on message-heavy shapes

Two cells moved the wrong way in v0.9.0 and are not explained by noise:

| benchmark | v0.7.1 | v0.8.0 | v0.9.0 | spread |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `google_message1_proto3/decode_view` | 998.2 | 911.0 | **836.3** | 2.37% |
| `media_frame/decode_view` | 53324 | 60188 | **55252** | 3.76% |

Both are -8.2% against v0.8.0, on spreads well under that, so the movement is real.
`google_message1_proto3` is the more concerning of the two: it has now declined for
two consecutive releases (-8.7%, then -8.2%), which is the pattern the ±5% band
exists to distinguish from noise, and it has cleared it.

These are the two most message-dense shapes in the matrix, and the leading
hypothesis is #250 — singular message fields stored inline by default. That change
is unambiguously good for owned decoding, and the same release's `decode` numbers
for both shapes stay inside the noise band (-1.8% and -2.4%) rather than falling
with the view path, so this looks view-specific rather than a general regression. It has not been root-caused; it is recorded here rather than
left for someone to rediscover in a chart.

## Layout normalization — why, and what it costs

Before normalization, the **placement** of otherwise-identical code was the limiting
factor on resolution. The clearest case was `json_encode` for the string/scalar-heavy
shapes, which *flapped*: LogRecord ran ~880 MiB/s at some releases and ~660 at
others, in lockstep across shapes, which no real code change would do (cross-version
spread 19%).

Disassembly settled that it was layout, not code. Comparing a fast and a slow
isolated LogRecord binary, **2390 of 2393 functions are byte-identical** after
normalizing addresses; the three that differ (`__rust_alloc_zeroed`, a `raw_vec`
error path, `main`) are not in the encode path. `serialize_str` and
`format_escaped_str` — the string-escaping hot loop that dominates this shape — are
identical instruction-for-instruction, just located at different addresses. Two
experiments confirmed it is the build, not the measurement: re-measuring the same
binary one-at-a-time reproduced the gap exactly, and rebuilding the identical commit
in a different directory flipped which version was slow.

`perf stat` then pinned the *mechanism* (and corrected an earlier guess). On a slow
vs a 64-byte-aligned build of the same code (IPC 2.87 vs 3.55), the Topdown
breakdown puts the slow layout's stall in Fetch **Bandwidth** — the **µop cache
(DSB)** — at 21.7% of slots vs 11.5%, with ~2× the DSB→legacy-decoder (MITE) switch
penalty (`dsb2mite_switches.penalty_cycles`), while Fetch *Latency* and the i-cache
/ cache-line miss counters barely move. The serde serialize path is a dense tree of
many small functions (string escaping, int/float formatting), so its hot loop is
unusually sensitive to how the µop cache packs it: a placement shift tips it out of
the DSB into the slower legacy decoder. (It is *not* a cache-line effect, as an
earlier reading had it — the counters say front-end bandwidth.)

**The fix.** Building every release with 64-byte block alignment restores clean DSB
delivery and lands each build on the fast layout. Re-measuring the whole matrix this
way tightened the cross-release spread on nearly every operation and collapsed the
JSON flap:

| operation | spread, as-shipped | spread, normalized |
|-----------|------:|------:|
| json_encode | 19.2% | 2.5% |
| decode_view | 12.7% | 8.8% |
| merge | 7.2% | 5.7% |
| decode | 5.7% | 4.0% |
| json_decode | 5.3% | 4.0% |
| compute_size | 2.8% | 2.5% |
| encode | 3.3% | 3.6% |
| **all** | **5.9%** | **4.2%** |

(cross-version (max−min)/median, median across messages.) The as-shipped column is
the prior median-of-15 campaign and the normalized column median-of-32, so the
smaller per-operation tightenings partly reflect the larger sample; the
`json_encode` collapse, however, is unambiguously the alignment — its flap was
deterministic layout, not sampling, as the disassembly showed. Only `encode` is
marginally worse, within noise. Crucially the real signals survived: the
AnalyticsEvent v0.4.0 regression and the PackedTile v0.7.1 jump are unchanged —
normalization removed the layout flaps without touching the code-driven steps. That
is the test that justified adopting it: **it flattens noise, not signal.** A BOLT
pass converges to the same fast layout (even from a no-LBR profile), independently
confirming the target is real and not an artifact of the alignment flag.

**The cost — read the curves as best-achievable layout.** Block alignment measures
the layout a profile-guided optimizer, or a lucky build, would reach — not the one a
plain `cargo build` ships. For a tracker whose job is "did buffa's *code* get
faster," that is the right frame: it isolates code from placement luck. For "what
will my service see from a default release build," the as-shipped number is lower and
noisier on the JSON path. The history answers the first question.

## Loop alignment — closing the gap block alignment left open (2026-06)

The block-alignment flag turned out to cover less than it appeared to.
`-align-all-nofallthru-blocks` aligns only blocks with **no fall-through
predecessor** — branch targets, which is the right treatment for the dispatch-heavy
decode paths — but a canonical loop head *has* a fall-through predecessor (its
preheader falls into it), so the flag skips most loop heads entirely. Disassembly of
`smoothutf8::verify_with_slack` made the gap concrete: under the block flag alone,
only 3 of 10 loop heads were 32-byte aligned. The hot loops the normalization was
adopted for were still rolling the placement dice.

The loop that decides `json_encode` is `serde_json`'s
`format_escaped_str_contents` byte-scan — a per-character table lookup that runs
once per byte of every string field, and whose body is **exactly 32 bytes**. A
three-phase bare-metal experiment (toolchain 1.95.0, lto=true, codegen-units=1,
spot c7i.metal-24xl) pinned its behaviour to one variable — the loop head's address
modulo 64:

| build | flags | loop head mod 64 | `log_record/json_encode` |
|-------|-------|---:|---:|
| monolithic | block only | 48 | 53.9 µs (slow) |
| monolithic | block + `-align-loops=32` | 0 | 41.5 µs (fast) |
| isolated | block only | 16 | 41.8 µs (fast) |
| isolated | block + `-align-loops=32` | 32 | 52.6 µs (slow) |
| monolithic | block + `-align-loops=64` | 0 | 41.5 µs (fast) |
| isolated | block + `-align-loops=64` | 0 | 39.2 µs (fast) |

Six builds, one rule: the loop is fast when its 32 bytes sit inside one 64-byte DSB
fetch window (head mod 64 ≤ 31) and ~25% slower when they straddle two — the same
front-end-bandwidth mechanism `perf stat` identified for the original flap. The
table also shows why **`-align-loops=32` is the wrong value here** even though it
was the right one for smoothutf8's (shorter) validation loop: 32-byte alignment
forces the head to mod 64 ∈ {0, 32}, and 32 is the *worst* placement for a 32-byte
body — guaranteed to straddle. The flag replaced one 50/50 lottery with another,
which is exactly what the inverted monolithic/isolated results measured.
`-align-loops=64` is the value that makes the placement unconditional: the loop can
never straddle, both build shapes land fast, and the isolated binary came out 6%
faster than the luckiest block-only build. The full five-shape sweep confirmed the
flag is otherwise neutral: every `json_encode` −7% to −28%, all other operations
within the run-to-run floor, +106 KB of padding on a 6.3 MB binary.

Two methodology notes fell out of the same experiment. First, a
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` change does **not** perturb layout at `lto=true,
codegen-units=1` — three "perturbed" builds differed in only 1347 of 4.6M text
bytes, all path-string immediates — so build-dir variation cannot be used as a
layout-noise probe at the pinned profile (the cgu sweep in
`build-cgu-variants.sh` remains the tool for that). Second, single-run deltas of
±8-9% appeared and evaporated between phases on benches the flag provably does not
affect; nothing below ~10% on a single criterion run should be read without an n≥3
replication or a disassembly-level mechanism.

## Why this replaced the earlier (sparse, coupled) history

An earlier version of this history built all shapes into one benchmark binary.
That made the per-shape numbers depend on which *other* shapes were present:
adding a message re-partitioned the compiler's inlining for the unchanged
decoders. It produced a convincing but false v0.7.1 regression — `MediaFrame`
`decode_view` read −13% purely because v0.7.1 added the `PackedTile` benchmark
message (proven by disassembly: removing PackedTile made MediaFrame's machine
code byte-identical to v0.7.0). Under per-message isolation that artifact is gone:
isolated `media_frame/decode_view` is flat across the whole series (≈44–48k MiB/s,
within spread). The dense isolated matrix exists so no cell can be contaminated
that way again, and so every shape has a full-history curve rather than starting
only at the release that added it to the suite.

## Caveats

These are medians of 3 runs measured 1-up, with per-benchmark spread recorded. Reproduction
across runs rules out random run noise but not deterministic per-binary effects;
with layout now normalized and isolation removing coupling, the remaining
real-versus-artifact test is persistence across *releases*. The matrix covers the
seven portable operations (decode, merge, encode, compute_size, decode_view,
json_encode, json_decode) — the bespoke `encode_view`/`build_encode` benchmarks use
newer view-encode APIs that did not exist in older releases, so they are not part of
the dense matrix and remain only on the releases that natively support them.
