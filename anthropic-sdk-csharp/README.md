# Claude SDK for C#

[![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Anthropic.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Anthropic)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of version 10+, the `Anthropic` package is now the official Claude SDK for C#. Package versions 3.X and below were previously used for the tryAGI community-built SDK, which has moved to [`tryAGI.Anthropic`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/tryagi.Anthropic/). If you need to continue using the former client in your project, update your package reference to `tryAGI.Anthropic`.

The Claude SDK for C# provides access to the [Claude API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/) from C# applications.
