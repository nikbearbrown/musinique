# BUILD-LOG — what-is-claude-mcp-connectors
Build date: 2026-07-24

## Gate P — ElevenLabs spend authorization
GATE P: signed by Bear, batch authorization, overnight playlist-intro run.
No per-reel gate required — batch authorization covers all ten reels.

## ASK→RESULT waiver
At ~90 seconds, inserting extra ClaudeComposerAsk micro-beats between B00 and B06 would
consume half the runtime. The body beats (B01-B05) ARE the result of B00's ask.
No additional composer beats inserted in the body. Logged once per reel per build instructions.

## TTS character count
See BATCH-STATUS.md for running total. Total batch: 15,270 / 25,000 ceiling.

## PIPELINE slates
B01, B02, B03 (if chip component unavailable), B04 (if text card component unavailable), B05 —
rendered as PIPELINE slates with specific descriptions of what each scene needs.
Remotion beats B00, B06, B07 use proven components: ClaudeComposerAsk, ClaudeTitleOutro.
