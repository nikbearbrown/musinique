// Package claude teaches the core reconciler about the Claude Developer
// Platform: which resources exist, what their files look like, which fields
// the server owns, and how to talk to the API.
//
// Everything Claude-specific in `ant apply` lives here. The core package holds
// the reconciler itself and does not import this one, so a fact about the API
// has exactly one home — and when the spec moves, this is the only directory
